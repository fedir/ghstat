initial discussion in #3 brought up the question whether the UUID standard module should support UUID versions other than v4 from the beginning.\r\n\r\nA rough analysis of the [BigQuery Github dataset revealed](https://github.com/bcoe/proposal-standard-module-uuid/issues/3#issuecomment-491510271) revealed the following usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRow version cnt   ratio \r\n1   v4      18318 0.797\r\n2   v1      4399  0.191\r\n3   v5      231   0.010\r\n4   v3      29    0.001\r\n```\r\n\r\n@littledan made the hypothesis that some part of `v1` UUID usage could actually be caused by developers having accidentally chosen the wrong UUID version since `v1` sounds much more like the \"default\" UUID type rather than `v4`.\r\n\r\nTo verify this hypothesis I suggest to look a bit deeper into the BigQuery Github dataset and:\r\n* Extract the repos that make use of v1\r\n* Sort them by github stars or watch count\r\n* Pick the most prominent modules and check how and why they use v1 UUIDs\r\n* Potentially get in touch with the maintainers of these modules to clarify why v1 is being used instead of v4\r\n\r\nWe could do the same for v3/5.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense to you?
