However, it renamed all the exports, and it also renamed \"exports\" as well, so now the package exports an empty object, which causes anything using preact to fail completely. Here's how the main export looks, built from the latest release directly:\r\n\r\n![](https://cl.ly/rDSE/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-26%20at%206.20.05%20PM.png)\r\n\r\nFor now, we are pinning to `8.2.7`, which fixes the problem.

I would greatly appreciate any insight! \r\n\r\nBefore I get into it, let me note that I am using unique, non-index-based `key` attributes in conjunction with `shouldComponentUpdate`.\r\n\r\n### My Particular Use Case\r\nI am building a grid component for my employer that requires \"pagination\". Basically, I have a set of data that must be rendered as a grid, but it must be configurable such that only a certain number of \"pages\" are rendered at one time. As the user navigates through the grid (using arrow keys), new grid cells will be rendered on one side and removed (not rendered) from the other. More specifically, as the user moves toward the end of the grid, new \"pages\" will be rendered at the end and the same number of \"pages\" will be removed from the beginning. The opposite occurs when moving toward the beginning. This ensures that the number of rendered \"pages\" is always the same. \r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\nThis is somewhat similar to #338 I believe, but what I've found is that when adding a page to the end (which also removes a page from the beginning) the entire set of `div`s (cells) flash with chrome's purple highlight color. What's interesting is this does _not_ happen when going the opposite way, i.e. when adding a page to the beginning (which removes a page from the end), only the first few `div`s flash as expected. What's also interesting is that `shouldComponentUpdate` is doing its job properly and apparently only rendering the cells that absolutely must be rendered. \r\n\r\n#### A short, non-confidential example\r\n##### Expected Behavior Example\r\nA coworker spun up a simple example to illustrate the problem. First, here's what we'd expect. This is with adding 1 element to one side and removing 1 element from the other:\r\n![rerender-expected](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13987407/39063951-891836e6-4481-11e8-9956-a1c3c4204cca.gif)\r\n\r\nHere is the code for this example:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport './style';\r\nimport { Component } from 'preact';\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default class App extends Component {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        super();\r\n\r\n        this.state = {\r\n            data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\r\n            direction: 1\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        document.onkeydown = (e) => {\r\n            e = e || window.event;\r\n\r\n            switch (e.keyCode) {\r\n                case 38: // up\r\n                    this.setState({\r\n                        direction: -1\r\n                    });\r\n                    break;\r\n                case 40: // down\r\n                    this.setState({\r\n                        direction: 1\r\n                    });\r\n                    break;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        setInterval(() => {\r\n            let newData = [...this.state.data];\r\n\r\n            if (this.state.direction === 1) {\r\n                newData.shift();\r\n                newData.push(newData[newData.length - 1] + 1);\r\n                // let lastElem = this.state.data[this.state.data.length - 1];\r\n                // const sliced = this.state.data.slice(2);\r\n                // sliced.push(++lastElem);\r\n                // sliced.push(++lastElem);\r\n                // newData = sliced;\r\n            } else {\r\n                let numToInsert = newData[0] - 1;\r\n\r\n                if (numToInsert > 0) {\r\n                    newData.pop(); // remove from tail\r\n                    newData.unshift(numToInsert); // insert at head\r\n                    // const sliced = this.state.data.slice(0, this.state.data.length - 2);\r\n                    // sliced.unshift(numToInsert--);\r\n                    // sliced.unshift(numToInsert);\r\n                    // newData = sliced;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            this.setState({\r\n                data: newData\r\n            });\r\n        }, 2000);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        const styles = {\r\n            width: '100px',\r\n            height: '50px',\r\n            border: '1px solid #000',\r\n            textAlign: 'center',\r\n            lineHeight: '50px'\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        const BoxArray = this.state.data.map(obj => {\r\n            return <div style={styles} key={obj}>{obj}</div>;\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        const directionStr = (this.state.direction === -1) ?

This is the behavior I'm seeing in my real use case:\r\n![rerender2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13987407/39063680-b28ba130-4480-11e8-8b0c-8f5dad8679b1.gif)\r\nHere is the modified code for this example:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport './style';\r\nimport { Component } from 'preact';\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default class App extends Component {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        super();\r\n\r\n        this.state = {\r\n            data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\r\n            direction: 1\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        document.onkeydown = (e) => {\r\n            e = e || window.event;\r\n\r\n            switch (e.keyCode) {\r\n                case 38: // up\r\n                    this.setState({\r\n                        direction: -1\r\n                    });\r\n                    break;\r\n                case 40: // down\r\n                    this.setState({\r\n                        direction: 1\r\n                    });\r\n                    break;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        setInterval(() => {\r\n            let newData = [...this.state.data];\r\n            // let newData;\r\n\r\n            if (this.state.direction === 1) {\r\n                // newData.shift();\r\n                // newData.push(newData[newData.length - 1] + 1);\r\n                let lastElem = this.state.data[this.state.data.length - 1];\r\n                const sliced = this.state.data.slice(2);\r\n                sliced.push(++lastElem);\r\n                sliced.push(++lastElem);\r\n                newData = sliced;\r\n            } else {\r\n                let numToInsert = newData[0] - 1;\r\n\r\n                if (numToInsert > 1) {\r\n                    // newData.pop(); // remove from tail\r\n                    // newData.unshift(numToInsert); // insert at head\r\n                    const sliced = this.state.data.slice(0, this.state.data.length - 2);\r\n                    sliced.unshift(numToInsert--);\r\n                    sliced.unshift(numToInsert);\r\n                    newData = sliced;\r\n

It's more of a question for best practice on using preactjs in this situation.\r\n\r\nSay i have a component which has 1 source of data, such as a list of customers.  Those customers have \"lookup\" fields, like customer type id, or address type id.  Those columns are typically displayed in selects.\r\n\r\nI have to fetch from 3 different places.

was having trouble understanding [some code in Component.prototype.setState](https://github.com/developit/preact/blob/80ad4367e5352cbf6720f973a4488f6504498eb9/src/component.js#L53-L59) when I came across it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet s = this.state;\r\nif (!this.prevState) this.prevState = extend({}, s);\r\nextend(s, typeof state==='function' ? state(s, this.props) : state);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt reads like `prevState` is only ever initialized once, and indeed this seems to be the case. If I add a method to a Component:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  componentDidUpdate(_, prevState) {\r\n    console.log(\"componentDidUpdate:\", prevState.ctr)\r\n    \r\n    setInterval(_ => {\r\n      this.setState(s => (s.ctr || 0) + 1)\r\n    }, 3e3)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter it is triggered the first time, it keeps logging \"componentDidUpdate: undefined\" every three seconds, rather than an increasing counter.\r\n\r\nI suspect there should be some code in vdom/component.js that deletes the prevState once [it is used](https://github.com/developit/preact/blob/0a88752e4890d391b5e23809d9432f625a833ae8/src/vdom/component.js#L67)?","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1010","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1010/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1010/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1010/events","html_url":"https://github.com/developit/preact/issues/1010","id":298872383,"number":1010,"title":"Identifier
