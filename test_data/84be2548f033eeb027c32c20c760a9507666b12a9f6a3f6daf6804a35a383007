Things are going pretty well.  I ran into something that i have not been able to solve or find others with same issue.  Clearly i am doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nI have a main page that has additional components that do not get \"shown\" until a modal pops up.  so for example ... <Component1 />  <Component2 />  each are just sitting in the render of <MainComponent>.\r\n\r\nWhen someone clicks a link, those modals popup with those components.  The very weird thing is how different this same code executes on a beefy server vs my MacBook.  On the server, I get errors because the dom elements i am using after component did mount in Component1 can not be found.\r\n\r\nSo my main page can not be rendered.
