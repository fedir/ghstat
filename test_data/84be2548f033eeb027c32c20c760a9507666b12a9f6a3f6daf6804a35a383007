Defining them is easy - using them, not so much. In plain Javascript I'd just do `new ClassName()`, but in Preact you use the `render` function, which returns a DOM node.\r\n\r\nI found #955 which relates to this and using the solution there I can get my instance and call its methods:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\tlet instance;\r\n\tlet ref = c => { instance = c; };\r\n\tpreact.render(<Menu ref={ref} />, menu.parent[0], menu[0] );\r\n\t\r\n\t// Then sometime later - after a socket update with new menu items:\r\n\tinstance.data( ... );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat feels really messy and doesn't feel like the right way of doing it with Preact. Its a lot of messing around just to get the class instance (rather than `let instance = new Menu()`).\r\n\r\nIs there a better way of doing this? Should I in fact be passing the `data` in as a property to a new `preact.render(<Menu...)` call? Does that reuse the old instance (it looks like a factory method, so I'm guessing not).\r\n\r\nI guess I'm just haven't a little trouble knowing what the right way to do it would be and meshing that with my old school way of thinking!","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1099","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1099/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1099/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1099/events","html_url":"https://github.com/developit/preact/issues/1099","id":322801442,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjI4MDE0NDI=","number":1099,"title":"Absolut import path","user":{"login":"theochampion","id":14275989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjc1OTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14275989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theochampion","html_url":"https://github.com/theochampion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theochampion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theochampion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theochampion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theochampion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theochampion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theochampion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theochampion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theochampion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theochampion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-05-14T12:46:58Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T17:11:14Z","closed_at":"2018-05-17T17:11:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi guys, \r\n\r\nI'm trying to find a way to use absolute imports path in my Preact app and I'm having troubles.\r\n\r\nCurrently my imports look like this\r\n```import Loading from '../../../../components/Loading';```\r\n\r\nand I want to be able to do this\r\n```import Loading from 'components/Loading';```\r\n\r\nTo do so, I tried overriding the `resolve` property in the webpack config\r\n\r\nHere is what my `preact.config.js` look like\r\n```\r\nimport asyncPlugin from \"preact-cli-plugin-fast-async\";\r\nimport path from \"path\";\r\nexport default config => {\r\n  asyncPlugin(config);\r\n\r\n  // tell webpack to watch all of our source\r\n  // (by default preact watch only /components)\r\n  // this way we can use CSS modules in /containers too\r\n  config.module.loaders[4].include = [\r\n    path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"containers\"),\r\n    path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"components\")\r\n  ];\r\n\r\n  config.module.loaders[5].exclude = [\r\n    path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"containers\"),\r\n    path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"components\")\r\n  ];\r\n  config.resolve.alias = {\r\n    src: path.resolve(__dirname, \"./src/\")\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this give me the following error \r\n`Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'preact-cli-entrypoint'`\r\n\r\nI suppose that the error is due to the fact that I override all existing aliases, but I can't find a way to make it work.

Here's how the main export looks, built from the latest release directly:\r\n\r\n![](https://cl.ly/rDSE/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-26%20at%206.20.05%20PM.png)\r\n\r\nFor now, we are pinning to `8.2.7`, which fixes the problem. Probably something should be done about this quickly, as it's a fairly critical issue.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1072","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1072/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1072/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/issues/1072/events","html_url":"https://github.com/developit/preact/issues/1072","id":316577865,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTY1Nzc4NjU=","number":1072,"title":"NPM published TypeScript definition still has \"linkState\"","user":{"login":"rdev","id":8418866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTg4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8418866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdev","html_url":"https://github.com/rdev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":876151250,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NzYxNTEyNTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/preact/labels/pr-welcome","name":"pr-welcome","color":"54e5ab","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-04-22T13:09:37Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T20:16:30Z","closed_at":"2018-04-22T15:40:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!

I would greatly appreciate any insight! \r\n\r\nBefore I get into it, let me note that I am using unique, non-index-based `key` attributes in conjunction with `shouldComponentUpdate`.\r\n\r\n### My Particular Use Case\r\nI am building a grid component for my employer that requires \"pagination\". Basically, I have a set of data that must be rendered as a grid, but it must be configurable such that only a certain number of \"pages\" are rendered at one time. As the user navigates through the grid (using arrow keys), new grid cells will be rendered on one side and removed (not rendered) from the other. More specifically, as the user moves toward the end of the grid, new \"pages\" will be rendered at the end and the same number of \"pages\" will be removed from the beginning. The opposite occurs when moving toward the beginning. This ensures that the number of rendered \"pages\" is always the same. \r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\nThis is somewhat similar to #338 I believe, but what I've found is that when adding a page to the end (which also removes a page from the beginning) the entire set of `div`s (cells) flash with chrome's purple highlight color. What's interesting is this does _not_ happen when going the opposite way, i.e. when adding a page to the beginning (which removes a page from the end), only the first few `div`s flash as expected. What's also interesting is that `shouldComponentUpdate` is doing its job properly and apparently only rendering the cells that absolutely must be rendered. \r\n\r\n#### A short, non-confidential example\r\n##### Expected Behavior Example\r\nA coworker spun up a simple example to illustrate the problem. First, here's what we'd expect. This is with adding 1 element to one side and removing 1 element from the other:\r\n![rerender-expected](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13987407/39063951-891836e6-4481-11e8-9956-a1c3c4204cca.gif)\r\n\r\nHere is the code for this example:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport './style';\r\nimport { Component } from 'preact';\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default class App extends Component {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        super();\r\n\r\n        this.state = {\r\n            data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\r\n            direction: 1\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        document.onkeydown = (e) => {\r\n            e = e || window.event;\r\n\r\n            switch (e.keyCode) {\r\n                case 38: // up\r\n                    this.setState({\r\n                        direction: -1\r\n                    });\r\n                    break;\r\n                case 40: // down\r\n                    this.setState({\r\n                        direction: 1\r\n                    });\r\n                    break;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        setInterval(() => {\r\n            let newData = [...this.state.data];\r\n\r\n            if (this.state.direction === 1) {\r\n                newData.shift();\r\n                newData.push(newData[newData.length - 1] + 1);\r\n                // let lastElem = this.state.data[this.state.data.length - 1];\r\n                // const sliced = this.state.data.slice(2);\r\n                // sliced.push(++lastElem);\r\n                // sliced.push(++lastElem);\r\n                // newData = sliced;\r\n            } else {\r\n                let numToInsert = newData[0] - 1;\r\n\r\n                if (numToInsert > 0) {\r\n                    newData.pop(); // remove from tail\r\n                    newData.unshift(numToInsert); // insert at head\r\n                    // const sliced = this.state.data.slice(0, this.state.data.length - 2);\r\n                    // sliced.unshift(numToInsert--);\r\n                    // sliced.unshift(numToInsert);\r\n                    // newData = sliced;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            this.setState({\r\n                data: newData\r\n            });\r\n        }, 2000);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        const styles = {\r\n            width: '100px',\r\n            height: '50px',\r\n            border: '1px solid #000',\r\n            textAlign: 'center',\r\n            lineHeight: '50px'\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        const BoxArray = this.state.data.map(obj => {\r\n            return <div style={styles} key={obj}>{obj}</div>;\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        const directionStr = (this.state.direction === -1) ? 'UP' : 'DOWN';\r\n\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n\t\t{BoxArray}\r\n\r\n                <div style=\"margin-top:20px\">\r\n                    Direction: {directionStr}\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Real Use Case Behavior\r\nAnd here is the same example, but with removing 2 elements from one side and adding 2 to the other. This is the behavior I'm seeing in my real use case:\r\n![rerender2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13987407/39063680-b28ba130-4480-11e8-8b0c-8f5dad8679b1.gif)\r\nHere is the modified code for this example:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport './style';\r\nimport { Component } from 'preact';\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default class App extends Component {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        super();\r\n\r\n        this.state = {\r\n            data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\r\n            direction: 1\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        document.onkeydown = (e) => {\r\n            e = e || window.event;\r\n\r\n            switch (e.keyCode) {\r\n                case 38: // up\r\n                    this.setState({\r\n                        direction: -1\r\n                    });\r\n                    break;\r\n                case 40: // down\r\n                    this.setState({\r\n                        direction: 1\r\n                    });\r\n                    break;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        setInterval(() => {\r\n            let newData = [...this.state.data];\r\n            // let newData;\r\n\r\n            if (this.state.direction === 1) {\r\n                // newData.shift();\r\n                // newData.push(newData[newData.length - 1] + 1);\r\n                let lastElem = this.state.data[this.state.data.length - 1];\r\n                const sliced = this.state.data.slice(2);\r\n                sliced.push(++lastElem);\r\n                sliced.push(++lastElem);\r\n                newData = sliced;\r\n            } else {\r\n                let numToInsert = newData[0] - 1;\r\n\r\n                if (numToInsert > 1) {\r\n                    // newData.pop(); // remove from tail\r\n                    // newData.unshift(numToInsert); // insert at head\r\n                    const sliced = this.state.data.slice(0, this.state.data.length - 2);\r\n                    sliced.unshift(numToInsert--);\r\n                    sliced.unshift(numToInsert);\r\n                    newData = sliced;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            this.setState({\r\n                data: newData\r\n            });\r\n        }, 2000);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        const styles = {\r\n            width: '100px',\r\n            height: '50px',\r\n            border: '1px solid #000',\r\n            textAlign: 'center',\r\n            lineHeight: '50px'\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        const BoxArray = this.state.data.map(obj => {\r\n            return <div style={styles} key={obj}>{obj}</div>;\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        const directionStr = (this.state.direction === -1) ?

It's more of a question for best practice on using preactjs in this situation.\r\n\r\nSay i have a component which has 1 source of data, such as a list of customers.  Those customers have \"lookup\" fields, like customer type id, or address type id.  Those columns are typically displayed in selects.\r\n\r\nI have to fetch from 3 different places.
