master was updated to Atmosphere 2.4.21.vaadin1 in commit d5ad32c20249f1eb91b5b7ad42ee770abf4c8803 (PR #10706)\r\n\r\nThis version of Atmosphere has a bug that manifests when running on Apache Tomcat.\r\nThis is a regression, it was fixed in 2.4.22 and 2.4.23.\r\nPlease upgrade to Atmosphere 2.4.23 (or later) before releasing Vaadin 8.4.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe necessary changes are the same as in d5ad32c20249f1eb91b5b7ad42ee770abf4c8803 (PR #10706), but somebody should build and publish a \"vaadin\" flavor of Atmosphere to be used here.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is downgrading to
