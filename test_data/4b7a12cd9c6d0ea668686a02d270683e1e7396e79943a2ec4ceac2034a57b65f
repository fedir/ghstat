The precompile steps are all happening as expected, the files are viewable on the heroku file system, but the route is returning a 404 instead of picking up the public/assets serve static assets directive.  There was a discussion on Gitter which I have saved off in this Gist (https://gist.github.com/cforcey/18dbd233c959984e6cff33faa04b58bd) which confirms fresh application installs pushed to Heroku have this issue.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Elixir / Hex version (mix hex.info):\r\n\r\n```\r\n±  |master ✓| → heroku run mix hex.info\r\nRunning mix hex.info on ⬢ voltmeter... up, run.3225 (Free)\r\nHex:    0.14.1\r\nElixir: 1.3.4\r\nOTP:    19.1\r\n\r\nBuilt with: Elixir 1.3.4 and OTP 18.3.4.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Node / NPM version (node -v) (npm -v):\r\n\r\n```\r\n±  |master ✓| → heroku run node -v\r\nRunning node -v on ⬢ voltmeter... up, run.8619 (Free)\r\nv4.3.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Operating system:\r\n\r\n```\r\n±  |master ✓| → heroku buildpacks\r\n=== voltmeter Buildpack URLs\r\n1. https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git\r\n2. heroku/nodejs\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nHeroku application shows dashboard HTML but fails to load assets.
