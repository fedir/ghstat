(For people who came here from _\"How do I create Emitter/Subject/Bus in Kefir?\"_ questions)\n\nKefir once had [Kefir.emitter()](https://github.com/rpominov/kefir/blob/v2/deprecated-api-docs.md#kefiremitter) that had both Stream and [Emitter](http://rpominov.github.io/kefir/#emitter-object) interfaces. Then it was removed, because:\n- We prefer to do things in declarative/functional style rather than imperative in Kefir and FRP\n- `Kefir.emitter()` is an imperative pattern\n- In 90% of cases `Kefir.emitter()` can be replaced with some declarative/functional style pattern (you can find some examples bellow in this thread)\n- Lack of `Kefir.emitter()` should inspire people to find that better patterns\n- In remaining 10% cases one can extract emitter from `Kefir.stream(emitter => ...)` (see https://github.com/rpominov/kefir/issues/88#issuecomment-92512136)\n\nAlso note that `Kefir.fromBinder()` mentioned often bellow is renamed to `Kefir.stream()` now.\n\nIf you have more questions, please continue discussion here rather that where from you have been redirected to this thread. So we have all answers in one place.\n\nBelow goes original issue body: \n\n---\n\n`Kefir.emitter()` looks like the most basic method for creating general purpose streams, but I think it actually an antipattern. Beginners tend to overuse it, but people who get FRP right, use it very rarely or even never.\n\nI think we should remove (deprecate) `Kefir.emitter()`, and advertise `Kefir.fromBinder()` as the main method for creating general purpose streams. And we should probably rename `Kefir.fromBinder()` to something looking less scary and more like a main method for creating streams — `Kefir.stream()` or something. Also `Kefir.bus()` should be removed, as it mostly same as `Kefir.emitter()`.\n\nThis proposition also aligns well with idea of minimizing API surface area https://github.com/pozadi/kefir/issues/71\n\n---\n\nHere is the issues one can run into when using `Kefir.emitter()`:\n\n1) Emitting before anyone listening:\n\n``` js\nvar emitter = Kefir.emitter();\nemitter.emit(1);\n\n// The callback obviously won't be called with `1`, but sometimes it\n// not so obvious for some people.\nemitter.onValue(function(x) {\n  console.log(x);\n});\n\n\n// Right way to achieve this\nvar stream = Kefir.fromBinder(function(emitter) {\n  emitter.emit(1);\n});\n\n// will log `1`\nstream.onValue(function(x) {\n  console.log(x);\n});\n```\n\n2) Resources are not managed correctly:\n\n``` js\n// bad\nfunction getStream() {\n  var emitter = Kefir.emitter();\n  // subscriber will never be removed\n  target.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n    emitter.emit(event);\n  });\n}\n\n// good\nfunction getStream() {\n  return Kefir.fromBinder(function(emitter) {\n    target.addEventListener('click', emitter.emit);\n    return function() {\n      // free resources\n      target.removeEventListener('click', emitter.emit);\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n3) A property not getting values from an emitter while not active (see http://pozadi.github.io/kefir/#active-state)\n\n4) Methods for emitting events are exposed for all users of emitter-srteam:\n\n``` js\nvar stream = getStream(); // using function from example above\n\n// no one stops me to doing:\nstream.emit(1);\n```\n\nAnd I guess there is more.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ractivejs/ractive/issues/3311","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ractivejs/ractive","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ractivejs/ractive/issues/3311/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ractivejs/ractive/issues/3311/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ractivejs/ractive/issues/3311/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/issues/3311","id":478422851,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0Nzg0MjI4NTE=","number":3311,"title":"Attribute

Also, overlays (markers, polylines, etc.) are misplaced (slightly towards north or maybe just upwards). If we use another Promise polyfill (like https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) the problem goes away. (The Maps API also has its own polyfill, btw)\r\n\r\nSo after figuring out that our Promise polyfill was to blame, I've tried to find what was wrong with it. I've executed the test suite in https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests but all the tests pass, so apparently no issues with the spec.\r\n\r\nThere are differences between the native Promise and the Ractive's Promise: Native one has functions defined in `Promise.prototype` (`then`, `catch` and `finally`) but Ractive's Promise constructor returns a POJO with `then` and `catch` functions and no functions are defined in `Promise.prototype`. However I'm not sure if this is really the reason to our problem.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nJust include another Promise polyfill before Ractive's.\r\n\r\n### What should be done?\r\n\r\nWe should either find what's wrong with Ractive's polyfill and fix it or just remove the Ractive's polyfill and use an external one.\r\n\r\n## Versions affected:\r\n\r\nAll\r\n\r\n## Platforms affected:\r\n\r\nBrowsers that lack support for `Promise`s.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction:\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/monoblaine/4hpdc7wz/8/ (Could be viewed in any browser)\r\n\r\nThe line `<script>window.Promise = undefined;</script>` is to bypass native `Promise`.\r\n\r\nThe following one is the expected output:\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/monoblaine/4hpdc7wz/11/","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aktos-io/scada.js/issues/110","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aktos-io/scada.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aktos-io/scada.js/issues/110/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aktos-io/scada.js/issues/110/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aktos-io/scada.js/issues/110/events","html_url":"https://github.com/aktos-io/scada.js/issues/110","id":238347230,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzgzNDcyMzA=","number":110,"title":"Push more components after page load","user":{"login":"ceremcem","id":6639874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Mzk4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6639874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceremcem","html_url":"https://github.com/ceremcem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceremcem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceremcem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceremcem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceremcem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceremcem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceremcem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceremcem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceremcem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceremcem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":540874695,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDA4NzQ2OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aktos-io/scada.js/labels/core","name":"core","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":621360608,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjEzNjA2MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aktos-io/scada.js/labels/enhancement%20/%20performance","name":"enhancement / performance","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-06-24T22:33:16Z","updated_at":"2018-07-26T00:28:43Z","closed_at":"2018-07-26T00:28:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Description:\r\n\r\nIf a user has correct permissions to see some data (for example a graph), then an appropriate component (eg. `bar-chart`) would be either: \r\n\r\n1.
