Generate a keypair using `ed25519-dalek`\r\n2. Feed the private component into snow's `Builder` as the local private key for an XX handshake\r\n3. When I call `get_remote_static()` after the handshake, I get a pubkey that is recognisable as the one from step 1\r\n\r\n(When I naively attempted to do so, `get_remote_static` returned a completely different set of bytes)\r\n\r\nor alternatively\r\n\r\n1. Generate a keypair using `snow`\r\n2. Concatenate the private and public parts to match `ed25519-dalek`'s `Keypair` format\r\n3. Instantiate the `Keypair` and sign something\r\n\r\n(When I naively attempted to do so, I received `Error: signature::Error { source: Some(Cannot decompress Edwards point) }`)\r\n\r\nI've attempted to trace what's going on but so far I've failed to bridge between the two.\r\n\r\n* Both crates generate a private key using a CSPRNG to fill 32 bytes\r\n* `snow` calls `x25519::x25519(self.privkey, x25519::X25519_BASEPOINT_BYTES)`, which adjusts the bits correctly and does the multiplication to get the pubkey\r\n* `ed25519-dalek` appears to be storing the seed instead - its [calculation of the `PublicKey`](https://docs.rs/ed25519-dalek/1.0.0/src/ed25519_dalek/public.rs.html#56-70) does the Sha512 hash. Then `mangle_scalar_bits_and_multiply_by_basepoint_to_produce_public_key` does what it sounds like, with an extra `compress()` step on the end. I am not very cryptographically literate and it's not clear to me if this compressed Edwards \"Y\" component is meant to be different from `snow`'s public key.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like one crate is starting from a seed whereas the other is implicitly starting from the hashed seed. I tried creating a [`ed25519_dalek::ExpandedSecretKey`](https://docs.rs/ed25519-dalek/1.0.0/ed25519_dalek/struct.ExpandedSecretKey.html), which [does the `Sha512`](https://docs.rs/ed25519-dalek/1.0.0/src/ed25519_dalek/secret.rs.html#260-298) and exposes the hashed key [in the first 32 bytes of its `to_bytes()`](https://docs.rs/ed25519-dalek/1.0.0/src/ed25519_dalek/secret.rs.html#334-340). I tried feeding this into `snow` as the private key and unfortunately the public keys still do not match.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftPremier/VstsExtensions/issues/118","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftPremier/VstsExtensions","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftPremier/VstsExtensions/issues/118/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftPremier/VstsExtensions/issues/118/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftPremier/VstsExtensions/issues/118/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MicrosoftPremier/VstsExtensions/issues/118","id":705783709,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MDU3ODM3MDk=","number":118,"title":"nothing

the bug**\r\nI faced https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/1227 some time ago, and while reviewing #2337, I noticed that we have the same pattern in Jaeger:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/02d45678ec9079ee91e19ad901ab7592aa4de085/cmd/query/app/server.go#L138-L145\r\n\r\nBasically, when gRPC is behind TLS, `cmux` can't determine the headers before doing the TLS handshake, and the TLS handshake happens at the gRPC layer. The end result is that all calls end up going to the HTTP handler when a client is attempting to establish a gRPC TLS connection.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Not reproducible at the moment, as there's a bug preventing the TLS flags from being exposed for gRPC in the Query component.\r\n\r\nA possible solution is mentioned here in a follow-up issue at OpenTelemetry Collector: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/1256#issuecomment-654975422","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openware/opendax/issues/205","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openware/opendax","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openware/opendax/issues/205/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openware/opendax/issues/205/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openware/opendax/issues/205/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openware/opendax/issues/205","id":682311738,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODIzMTE3Mzg=","number":205,"title":"Error: Version in \"./compose/app.yaml\" is unsupported.","user":{"login":"ictinc","id":3803548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDM1NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3803548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ictinc","html_url":"https://github.com/ictinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ictinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ictinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ictinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ictinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ictinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ictinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ictinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ictinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ictinc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2020-08-20T02:25:25Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T00:59:37Z","closed_at":"2020-08-21T00:59:37Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Running Ubuntu 16.04 on GCP.\r\nDocker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe\r\ndocker-compose version 1.8.0, build unknown\r\n\r\nAfter running:\r\n`rake service:all`\r\n\r\nI get the following:\r\n`----- Starting the proxy -----\r\ndocker-compose up -d proxy\r\nERROR: Version in \"./compose/app.yaml\" is unsupported.

Zero and positive values denote success, while negative values signal failure. Possible values are listed below.\r\n#define EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS              0\r\n// The operation succeeded.\r\n#define EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_DEFERRED             1\r\n// The requested operation cannot be completed now for web security reasons, and has been deferred for completion in the next event handler.\r\n```\r\nThe [docs also say](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/html5.h.html#c.emscripten_webgl_create_context) that the return type of `emscripten_webgl_create_context` is:\r\n> On success, a strictly positive value that represents a handle to the created context. On failure, a negative number that can be cast to an EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT field to get the reason why the context creation failed.\r\n\r\nThat means that when everything is good it returns 1 in my machine and will do some initializations later on, since it's deferred, that's all good. When trying to use a custom canvas name however, the return I get is 0.\r\n\r\nAccording to the docs, that's not even possible? It's supposed to get an `strict positive on success` or `a negative on failure`? Well I get a 0, which also, according to the docs is a success. It's confusing. However if the only change is the canvas name, and it really succeeded I would expect to get a 1, since that's what a success returns when using a default canvas.\r\n\r\nAnyway my point is, that it's al weird and that I believe the context creation is failing, but the only difference is that name of the canvas, so I have no clue how to debug this. Hopefully it's just a silly thing I'm doing wrong... Is there any examples of the canvas name being different and working?\r\n\r\nNot sure if related but as a side note... If I set the name as default in my .c source, and create 2 canvas like this in my html.\r\n```html\r\n<canvas id=\"aaaa\"/>\r\n<canvas id=\"canvas\"/>\r\n```\r\nEven though by default it should take the 2nd one, it actually takes the first one... I'm really confused.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelwmale/webhook-action/issues/17","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelwmale/webhook-action","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelwmale/webhook-action/issues/17/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelwmale/webhook-action/issues/17/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelwmale/webhook-action/issues/17/events","html_url":"https://github.com/joelwmale/webhook-action/issues/17","id":686091530,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODYwOTE1MzA=","number":17,"title":"Error with triggering webhook","user":{"login":"AnandChowdhary","id":2841780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDE3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2841780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnandChowdhary","html_url":"https://github.com/AnandChowdhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnandChowdhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnandChowdhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnandChowdhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnandChowdhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnandChowdhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnandChowdhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnandChowdhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnandChowdhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnandChowdhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1506993538,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTA2OTkzNTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelwmale/webhook-action/labels/question","name":"question","color":"d876e3","default":true,"description":"Further information is requested"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2020-08-26T07:45:06Z","updated_at":"2020-08-27T08:27:32Z","closed_at":"2020-08-27T08:09:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Since v2, I'm getting an error triggering webhooks.
