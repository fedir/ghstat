First of all, I'd like to propose a more semantically correct (imho) version: `<% if @changeset.errors? do %>`. I know this is a part of the _Ecto_ wrapper, but I also think they shouldn't make changes like these, which brings me to another point;\r\n\r\nI definitely agree with a notion of _Context_ for hiding complexity and implementation details. It is a simple and powerful concept for separating persistence mechanism. Long story short; there probably should be another abstraction around the _Changeset_ so that we don't have to propagate it all the way to the views. What do you guys think?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMatej","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2897","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2897/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2897/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2897/events","html_url":"https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2897","id":326667280,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjY2NjcyODA=","number":2897,"title":"I

No socket connection is established.\r\n\r\nWithin the logs, the following can be witnessed\r\n````\r\n[info] GET /socket/websocket\r\n[debug] ** (Phoenix.Router.NoRouteError) no route found for GET /socket/websocket (DingenWeb.Router)\r\n    (dingen_web) lib/dingen_web/router.ex:1: DingenWeb.Router.__match_route__/4\r\n    (dingen_web) lib/phoenix/router.ex:303: DingenWeb.Router.call/2\r\n    (dingen_web) lib/dingen_web/endpoint.ex:1: DingenWeb.Endpoint.plug_builder_call/2\r\n    (dingen_web) lib/plug/debugger.ex:102: DingenWeb.Endpoint.\"call (overridable 3)\"/2\r\n    (dingen_web) lib/dingen_web/endpoint.ex:1: DingenWeb.Endpoint.call/2\r\n    (plug) lib/plug/adapters/cowboy/handler.ex:16: Plug.Adapters.Cowboy.Handler.upgrade/4\r\n    (cowboy) /path/to/project/dingen_umbrella/deps/cowboy/src/cowboy_protocol.erl:442: :cowboy_protocol.execute/4\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Probable cause\r\nAfter some investigation on my side, this behaviour seems to be caused by `Phoenix.Endpoint.CowboyHandler.child_spec/3` and the private function `Phoenix.Endpoint.CowboyHandler.default_for/1`.\r\nThe `default_for/1` function is called by `child_spec/3` in order to resolve the `handler` module for the connection. But `default_for/1` does return `nil` for every passed in argument except the built in transports `LongPoll` and `WebSocket` which causes the handler to be `nil` for any custom transport.\r\nAs a result, the cowboy dispatches list does not contain dispatch items for custom transports which  does explain the 404s when a custom transport is used (to the best of my knowledge).\r\nFor the relevant code see [cowboy_handler.ex lines 83 to 113](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/lib/phoenix/endpoint/cowboy_handler.ex#L83-L113)\r\nThe same issue seems to be present within the [cowboy2_handler.ex module](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/lib/phoenix/endpoint/cowboy2_handler.ex#L80-L118).\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2869","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2869/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2869/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2869/events","html_url":"https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2869","id":318849115,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTg4NDkxMTU=","number":2869,"title":"Prepare
