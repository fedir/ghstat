The limitation being if the error happens before the request reaches the Router in the Endpoint, and I haven't been able to find a way I like to catch them.\r\n\r\nSince `Phoenix.Endpoint` defines an overridable `call/2` [here](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/lib/phoenix/endpoint.ex#L725-L736) I was thinking I could override and include my own error handling code by adding something like:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# lib/my_app_web/endpoint.ex\r\n# ...\r\ndef call(conn, opts) do\r\n  IO.inspect(conn.private)\r\n  conn = put_in conn.secret_key_base, config(:secret_key_base)\r\n  conn = put_in conn.script_name, script_name()\r\n  conn = Plug.Conn.put_private(conn, :phoenix_endpoint, __MODULE__)\r\n\r\n  try do\r\n    super(conn, opts)\r\n  catch\r\n    kind, reason ->\r\n      stack = System.stacktrace()\r\n      MyErrorHandlingService.report(kind, reason, stack)\r\n      Phoenix.Endpoint.RenderErrors.__catch__(conn, kind, reason, @phoenix_render_errors)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# => %{phoenix_endpoint: MyAppWeb.Endpoint}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works in that my error handling service gets called. The issue with it is it seems like both the original `call/2` that Phoenix.Endpoint defines gets called first, and then mine gets called. It seems that way because the inspect above prints out `:private` with the endpoint module before my code puts it in there.\r\n\r\nI also tried to `use Plug.ErrorHandler` in the Endpoint, but any `handle_errors/2` that get defined don't get called. I'm guessing because `Phoenix.Endpoint` works similarly in defining an overridable `call/2` function?\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI'm not sure how I would expect to be able to handle the errors. I'm happy to try solutions I have missed or put together a PR.\r\n\r\nIf there isn't a good way currently, being able to define a function to handle errors in the `Phoenix.Endpoint` catch could work (similar to `Plug.ErrorHandler`), but I'm open to anything that makes it easier 🙂 ","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2790","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2790/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2790/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2790/events","html_url":"https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2790","id":303436350,"number":2790,"title":"Phoenix v1.3.1 umbrella have no apps","user":{"login":"Vorzious","id":7570448,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7570448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vorzious","html_url":"https://github.com/Vorzious","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vorzious/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vorzious/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vorzious/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vorzious/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vorzious/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vorzious/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vorzious/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vorzious/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vorzious/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-03-08T10:49:22Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T13:53:16Z","closed_at":"2018-03-08T13:53:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Phoenix v1.3.1 seems to have some undocumented changes or errors when working with umbrella.
