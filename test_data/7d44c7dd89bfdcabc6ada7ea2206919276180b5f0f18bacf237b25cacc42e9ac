order to complete H2 support in Phoenix we need to support a mechanism for the server to push or hint resources. There are two mechanisms for this now: Early Hints and Push Promises.\r\n\r\nInitially I was hoping to add support for Early Hints but during the process it became apparent that it may be months before *any* of the major web browser support early hints. (This is based on a conversation on twitter with Ilya.)\r\n\r\nThat means at least initially we need to support Push Promise as well.\r\n\r\nI've looked at how Rails has added support for Push Promise (I know they say that they are doing early hints, but that's not 100% accurate. They are using h2o to convert an early hint from puma into a push promise.) We can do the same thing for anyone that wants to proxy through h2o like rails does. H2O is using a technique called CASPer when they store a representation of a list of assets on the client in a cookie.\r\n\r\nTheir implementation is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/h2o/h2o/blob/master/lib/http2/casper.c\r\n\r\nAs discussion of it is here:\r\nhttps://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/http2_directives.html#http2-casper\r\n\r\nTL;DR they are using golomb compressed sets (https://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/04/29/filters.html) aka a bloom filter.\r\n\r\nSo to support Early Hints and Push Promises we need:\r\n\r\n1. a dependency for a Bloom filter. (maybe https://github.com/gmcabrita/bloomex)\r\n2. functions to read and write the cookie.\r\n3. functions to get a list of the assets that should be pushed for a page.\r\n4. a function that takes a list of assets and the cookie and determines which assets to push.\r\n5. a function that connects this all into a push promise.\r\n6. a function that uses the list from 3 to do early hints.\r\n\r\nI think we should support them both. This gives the end use maximum flexibility and there's very little extra effort on top of Push Promise needed to support Early Hints.\r\n\r\nI am hoping to gather some feedback on this and then I will start working on a PR. \r\n\r\nPlug already has support for Push Promise (but there's going to be a Cowboy fix before it fully works) and there's an open PR for Early Hints support.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2874","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2874/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2874/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2874/events","html_url":"https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2874","id":320815166,"number":2874,"title":"Add prefix option to Router.Helpers","user":{"login":"KamilLelonek","id":3199333,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3199333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamilLelonek","html_url":"https://github.com/KamilLelonek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamilLelonek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamilLelonek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamilLelonek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamilLelonek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamilLelonek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamilLelonek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamilLelonek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamilLelonek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamilLelonek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-05-07T13:57:52Z","updated_at":"2018-05-07T14:47:21Z","closed_at":"2018-05-07T14:02:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!--\r\n### Precheck\r\n\r\n* For help and support, use Stack Overflow or the Phoenix Talk mailing list\r\n* For proposing a new feature, start a discussion on the Phoenix Core mailing list\r\n* For bugs, do a quick search and make sure the bug has not yet been reported\r\n* Ensure that this issue is related to the Phoenix library and not one of the dependencies listed in mix.exs (Ecto, Plug, etc.)\r\n* All checked?

No socket connection is established.\r\n\r\nWithin the logs, the following can be witnessed\r\n````\r\n[info] GET /socket/websocket\r\n[debug] ** (Phoenix.Router.NoRouteError) no route found for GET /socket/websocket (DingenWeb.Router)\r\n    (dingen_web) lib/dingen_web/router.ex:1: DingenWeb.Router.__match_route__/4\r\n    (dingen_web) lib/phoenix/router.ex:303: DingenWeb.Router.call/2\r\n    (dingen_web) lib/dingen_web/endpoint.ex:1: DingenWeb.Endpoint.plug_builder_call/2\r\n    (dingen_web) lib/plug/debugger.ex:102: DingenWeb.Endpoint.\"call (overridable 3)\"/2\r\n    (dingen_web) lib/dingen_web/endpoint.ex:1: DingenWeb.Endpoint.call/2\r\n    (plug) lib/plug/adapters/cowboy/handler.ex:16: Plug.Adapters.Cowboy.Handler.upgrade/4\r\n    (cowboy) /path/to/project/dingen_umbrella/deps/cowboy/src/cowboy_protocol.erl:442: :cowboy_protocol.execute/4\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Probable cause\r\nAfter some investigation on my side, this behaviour seems to be caused by `Phoenix.Endpoint.CowboyHandler.child_spec/3` and the private function `Phoenix.Endpoint.CowboyHandler.default_for/1`.\r\nThe `default_for/1` function is called by `child_spec/3` in order to resolve the `handler` module for the connection. But `default_for/1` does return `nil` for every passed in argument except the built in transports `LongPoll` and `WebSocket` which causes the handler to be `nil` for any custom transport.\r\nAs a result, the cowboy dispatches list does not contain dispatch items for custom transports which  does explain the 404s when a custom transport is used (to the best of my knowledge).\r\nFor the relevant code see [cowboy_handler.ex lines 83 to 113](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/lib/phoenix/endpoint/cowboy_handler.ex#L83-L113)\r\nThe same issue seems to be present within the [cowboy2_handler.ex module](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/lib/phoenix/endpoint/cowboy2_handler.ex#L80-L118).\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2869","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2869/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2869/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2869/events","html_url":"https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2869","id":318849115,"number":2869,"title":"Prepare

The tutorial has been very clear and enjoyable. Up to this point I have known what to type and what to try out. \r\n\r\nUp until this point every bit of code has been given with the filename that I should edit.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nStarting at this section there are different options for the `forward` macro. Should I use the first one or do I add authentication? The information in this section is useful but I do not know what I should type to follow the tutorial.\r\n\r\nAlso starting at the paragraph:\r\n> However for convenience and to allow you to test the code above, here is the implementation of BackgroundJob.Plug that you can copy into your application:\r\n\r\nAs a beginner, It is not clear to me where plugins should go in a Phoenix application.
