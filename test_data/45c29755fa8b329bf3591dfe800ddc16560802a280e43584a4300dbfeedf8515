Hugo, the default `outputs` configuration looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[outputs]\r\n  page = [\"HTML\"] \r\n  home = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\"] \r\n  section = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\"] \r\n  taxonomy = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\"] \r\n  taxonomyTerm = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what you get when doing nothing.\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour says that _if you provide your own outputs configuration, it must be complete._\r\n\r\nWe do, however, add `HTML` as a fallback for a missing config entry. But, currently, if you want to add `JSON` to the home page (for a search index), this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[outputs]\r\n  home = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"JSON\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\nWill result in missing `RSS` for the other list types.\r\n\r\nThis is surprising for users. See https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/408\r\n\r\n* `outputFormats`, `mediaTypes`, `related`, `outputs`, `permalinks`(and maybe others) translates into a `map` in the config.\r\n* For maps with entries of the same type (`mediaTypes`), Hugo allows redefinition of just one or more entries.\r\n* For maps with entries of different types (`related`), you must provide the full configuration. The different entries only make sense in relation to the others.\r\n\r\nWe will follow the rule in the above and change the way `outputs` behaves. \r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4486","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4486/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4486/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4486/events","html_url":"https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4486","id":304034525,"number":4486,"title":"The Hugo was coredumped on OpenBSD/current","user":{"login":"ssh3","id":5206528,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5206528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssh3","html_url":"https://github.com/ssh3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssh3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssh3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssh3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssh3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssh3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssh3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssh3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssh3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssh3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":501513591,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/labels/NeedsUserFeedback","name":"NeedsUserFeedback","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-03-10T02:40:49Z","updated_at":"2018-03-10T08:59:17Z","closed_at":"2018-03-10T08:59:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There is a problem with running [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) on the last OpenBSD snapshot.\r\n```\r\nOpenBSD 6.3-beta (GENERIC.MP) #46: Fri Mar  9 08:22:22 MST 2018\r\n\r\npuffy-user@balamut:~$ date;
