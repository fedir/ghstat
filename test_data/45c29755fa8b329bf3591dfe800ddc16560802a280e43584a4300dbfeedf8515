issues: #4616 #4748 #4749 #4764 #4765 #4766 #4755 \r\n\r\nOk. @bep 's reservations about Simple Mode Hugo shortcodes got me googling again about the GDPR (as if I haven't done it enough during the past few months).\r\n\r\nAnd I just discovered a couple of new things:\r\n\r\n1. Some consider that even the loading of images from external servers is a GDPR privacy violation, because the server where the image is stored receives the IP of the visitor in order to serve it and that's Personally Identifiable information under the GDPR. Link [here](https://www.amazeemetrics.com/en/blog/5-gdpr-quick-fixes-your-website)\r\n\r\n2. While others think that cross-linking  of things and sharing information is the basis of the internet and that is something that will be very hard to prevent GDPR or not. Link [here](https://invisioncommunity.com/news/community-management/your-gdpr-questions-answered-r1086/?page=3)\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind the Simple Mode Shortcodes was to disable the user tracking of 3rd party services through iframe embeds. It c
8000
an be done but it is very time consuming, adds overhead to the maintenance of the Hugo project and the end result does not match the functionality of the 3rd party embeds that come with user tracking.\r\n\r\nSo what do we do? \r\n\r\n1. Scrap the Simple Mode Shortcodes and go for a consent mechanism as described [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4766#issuecomment-391786630)\r\n\r\n2. Or continue with the Simple Mode shortcodes?\r\n\r\nThat is the million dollar question.\r\n\r\nPS I'll post about this and ask user feedback in the Forum also.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4766","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4766/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4766/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4766/events","html_url":"https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4766","id":326042599,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjYwNDI1OTk=","number":4766,"title":"GDPR:
