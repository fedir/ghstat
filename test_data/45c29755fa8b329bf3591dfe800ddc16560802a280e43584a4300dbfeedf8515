If I use codefences, the styles are **not** applied.\r\n\r\nThis is because, when using codefences, the code is not wrapped in a div with the `highlight` style applied and the `data-lang` attribute is not added to the `<code>` tag.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly not the behaviour [implied in the documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlight-in-code-fences) and not the behaviour I would expect.\r\n\r\nIt makes migration from other platforms really difficult in addition to making it needlessly complex to write posts containing code.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this would be fixed so that codefences have the same behaviour as implied in the current documentation. Otherwise, at least the documentation should be updated to reflect what actually happens.\r\n\r\nAs a footnote, it would also be helpful to noobs if the documentation about generating the syntax.css file were slightly expanded to explain that this file should go in the `static` folder and be included in the master layout `baseof.html`.\r\n\r\nIn case you think that I am being a little harsh, please let me also take this opportunity to say that Hugo is far and away the best static site generator that I've used. I've only just started using it and I've already been able to create a theme from scratch and migrate a rather gnarly WordPress site.

followed the [quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to create a new site, and add some testing pages. I did some random tests by moving files from one folder to another, or creating new ones, but hugo did not respond as I expected. Here's how to reproduce this problem.\r\n\r\n1. Follow the quickstart to create a new site. Start the sever \"hugo server -w\"\r\n2. Manually create some folders in \"content\" directory, say, \"about\", \"install\".\r\n3. Manually add index.md to each of the folders \"about\" and \"install\"\r\n4. Create a file \"aa.md\" under \"about\", go to \"localhost:1313/about/aa\" to see if the changes are detected\r\n5. Move \"aa.md\" from \"about\" to \"install\", go to go to \"localhost:1313/install/aa\"\r\n6. More similar tests.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that hugo uses cached data, instead of updating the directory and file structures each time you make changes. For example, if you want hugo to know the changes in folder \"about\", you have to change \"about\" to some other name, i.e. \"abouts\" and then change it back to \"about\", now in this way hugo knows what has changed and files in \"about\" will be detected by hugo. Otherwise, no consist way to make hugo know what has changed!!","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4539","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4539/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4539/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4539/events","html_url":"https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4539","id":308514831,"number":4539,"title":"Page rendered only after move","user":{"login":"sascha-andres","id":3052075,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3052075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-andres","html_url":"https://github.com/sascha-andres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-andres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-andres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-andres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-andres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-andres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-andres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-andres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-andres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-andres/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-03-26T10:25:05Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T05:49:41Z","closed_at":"2018-03-26T17:06:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# Prerequisites\r\n\r\nAssume the structure in /content:\r\n\r\n    /cv\r\n        index.md\r\n    index.md\r\n\r\n# Current bahavior\r\nThe index.md gets rendered always, but CV does not.
