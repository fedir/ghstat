If I rebuild, some are corrected and others are re-written incorrectly. If I rebuild again (**with no edits**), sometimes it will fix it's self but I can't truly verify without going thru every page.\r\n\r\nI have tested this on booth on Ubuntu and Windows machines with the same results (using Hugo v0.38.2). I don't think this is a theme issue because I switched themes with the same results as well (Below is the `featured image` snippet - just in case I have something wrong). However, this was tested on C9, another Ubuntu workstation, and a Windows 10 (VS code) workstation with two independent themes resulting with same undesired results.\r\n\r\nAttached are 3 screen-shoots of the same page after it was rebuilt using `hugo` - Re-generated seconds apart **without editing**. What I am seeing is that the engine is (randomly) generating bogus URL links by adding a non-existing folder in the string.\r\n\r\n**e.g. (see attachments)**\r\n**_hugo's wrong generated link:_**  `http://localhost:1313/img/2017/122017/12/Blue_Front_Inn.jpg`\r\n**_The expected URL should be:_** `http://localhost:1313/img/2017/12/Blue_Front_Inn.jpg`\r\nAs seen in this example, hugo added a `.../12201/...`\r\n\r\n![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6665669/38630610-48f2f4aa-3d6c-11e8-977b-46c11f700e3b.PNG)\r\n![capture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6665669/38630611-4935378e-3d6c-11e8-9336-01414eaaa1e7.PNG)\r\n![capture3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6665669/38630612-49527402-3d6c-11e8-93d1-a736bdf4334e.PNG)\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{ if and (isset .Params \"featuredpath\") (ne .Params.featuredpath \"\") }}\r\n    {{ $.Scratch.Set \"path\" .Params.featuredpath }}\r\n\r\n    {{ if and (isset .Params \"featured\") (ne .Params.featuredpath \"\") }}\r\n        {{ $.Scratch.Set \"structType\" \"page\" }}\r\n        {{ partial \"img-path\" . }}\r\n        {{ $path := $.Scratch.Get \"path\" }}\r\n        {{ $alt := $.Scratch.Get \"alt\" }}\r\n        {{ $img := $.Scratch.Get \"img\" }}\r\n\r\n        <a href=\"{{ .RelPermalink }}\" class=\"image featured\">\r\n            <img src=\"{{ $path | relURL }}/{{ .Params.featured }}\" alt=\"{{ $alt }}\">\r\n        </a>\r\n    {{ end }}\r\n{{ end }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have also discovered this is true when the build has been written to memory and to a `/public/` directory.
