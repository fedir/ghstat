For example, scene editors, visual scripting editors, tree views of components, etc.\r\n\r\nHotreloading should be at the core of most tooling. Modifying an entity file in any way should be updated in the game world for fast iteration. Some basic CLI around amethyst could make this easier:\r\n`amethyst watch` could open an \"editor window\" and watches for modifications to the files related to the game for updates.\r\n\r\nGame state in the editor should be handled in two modes, halted and running In the halted mode the world does not have systems running and no components should be modified by the game. Modifications in this mode should come from tools that can modify the files related to the game and have it updated in the game. Alternatively, tooling could also interact with the game world, for example clicking on some `Mesh` in the editor could highlight the entity related in the tooling as well as able to be moved around.\r\n\r\nIt would also be ideal if most tooling was under one UI toolkit so it would be possible to have layouts of tools from different libraries.

(his system  incidentally also works for non-sparkle appcasts, but currently most of the Casks that have no sparkle, also have no appcast-stanza)\r\n\r\ntherefore i've been focusing my efforts on automatically finding outdated Casks on those without \"sparkle appcast\". every day i let a script run that compares the version of the Casks without appcast, to the database of app-versions that our company maintains. every day the script finds around 5 - 10 outdated Casks that should be updated e.g. using 'cask-repair'.\r\n\r\nthe design and implementation of the system is discussed here: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/52837\r\nand there was also a bit discussion about this here:\r\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/54811\r\n\r\n\r\nso, long story short, basically it would be great if the community could have a look at the\r\n\"cr-processed-DATE.txt\"\r\nfiles i place here:\r\nhttp://macupdater.net/cask-repair/\r\neach day and look through them to see which of those entries are real, official new releases of the apps and submit cask-repairs accordingly. i think this would also be a good task to get started with contributing to HBC.\r\n\r\nfor the time being, it would be best to note false positives (i.e. entries that are not real official releases of this app) here so i'll add them to the different filter-lists in the postprocessing script so that they won't appear in the next days output anymore.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 11.dec.2018:\r\nok, the cask-repair system for apps without appcast has been working quite well over the past month, i guess around 80% success rate (i.e. percentage of entries in the txt files that are actually valid new releases). but, it seems like there are quite a lot of casks WITH appcast that are outdated despite the appcast. so i've implemented two new checks to try to improve the situation there:\r\n\r\ncrsparklefeed-DATE.txt\r\n=> this checks each cask with an valid sparkle appcast each day and generates an output if the appcast has a new 'newest' entry since yesterday. since sparkle feeds should only contain valid releases, 100% of those should be valid updates to be done via 'cask-repair' (if someone else hasn't beaten you to it).\r\n\r\ncrgithub-DATE.txt\r\n=> this checks each cask that has its releases on github (as denoted via the URL or APPCAST stanza) and checks github if a new release has been posted since yesterday. if available, it tries to query the 'Latest Release' as denoted on github by the developer, so that beta releases are not picked up. if no 'Latest Release' is marked, it falls back to just using the newest release and downgrades from error to warning.

In my case I need the actual font in order to compute the size of a text widget, and I need the SpriteSheet information to know the size of an Image widget, for example.  \r\n\r\nSadly, that means that **my Renderer has to borrow the ECS world** somehow (or **at least borrow from it**, the problem here remains the same), effectively making it invalid for the 'static lifetime.    \r\n\r\nBut, `iced_native` requires the Renderer to be 'static on some implementation of widget. I thought it was strange, so I had a look at `iced_native`. \r\n\r\nAs it turns out, the only reason why a renderer should be 'static is because of the implementation of `hash_layout` that uses e.g. `std::any::TypeId::of::<Column<'_, (), Renderer>>().hash(state);`, which requires the type to be 'static. \r\n\r\nAIUI the only reason this `.hash` is called is so that every widget leaves a different \"footprint\" for the hash_layout result. This can also be implemented with a marker type, to avoid applying a constraint on the renderer, unless I completely misunderstood the point. Example for Column widget : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hecrj/iced/blob/master/native/src/widget/column.rs\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Debug, Hash)]\r\n/// Marker type for layout-hashing of Column Widget\r\npub struct ColumnWidget;\r\n\r\nimpl<'a, Message, Renderer> Widget<Message, Renderer>\r\n    for Column<'a, Message, Renderer>\r\nwhere\r\n    Renderer: self::Renderer, // Notice how the renderer no longer needs to be 'static\r\n{\r\n    // ... omitted \r\n    fn hash_layout(&self, state: &mut Hasher) {\r\n        std::any::TypeId::of::<ColumnWidget>().hash(state);\r\n\r\n        self.width.hash(state);\r\n        self.height.hash(state);\r\n        self.max_width.hash(state);\r\n        self.max_height.hash(state);\r\n        self.align_items.hash(state);\r\n        self.spacing.hash(state);\r\n\r\n        for child in &self.children {\r\n            child.widget.hash_layout(state);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI applied this change on a local version, everything looks good.\r\n\r\nAre there any other motivation as to why a Renderer should be 'static ? The requirement looks a bit unnecessary to me. \r\n\r\nHappy easter! \r\nCheers","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mjolnirapp/mjolnir/issues/523","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mjolnirapp/mjolnir","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mjolnirapp/mjolnir/issues/523/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mjolnirapp/mjolnir/issues/523/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mjolnirapp/mjolnir/issues/523/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mjolnirapp/mjolnir/issues/523","id":46608939,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NjYwODkzOQ==","number":523,"title":"Adding spaces support","user":{"login":"mhdismail","id":4080121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODAxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4080121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhdismail","html_url":"https://github.com/mhdismail","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhdismail/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhdismail/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhdismail/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhdismail/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhdismail/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhdismail/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhdismail/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhdismail/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhdismail/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1812153552,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODEyMTUzNTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mjolnirapp/mjolnir/labels/no-issue-activity","name":"no-issue-activity","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2014-10-23T10:15:37Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T00:08:12Z","closed_at":"2020-02-04T00:08:12Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I used Amethyst before, it had some issues but it was possible to move windows between spaces.\n\nI checked the source code, he made a small framework called Silica and you can check what he's doing here: \nhttps://github.com/ianyh/Silica/blob/master/Silica/SIWindow.m#L189\n\nBasically he's emulating the mouse move, at least it works.

One of the ideas proposed was to have flexible scripting files that could be used as config files.\r\n\r\n> I already toyed with an idea for an alternative to the classic scripting approach. I wondered if we could just have pretty flexible config files, like we plan already for entities and other stuff of the engine. I mean, this does not conflict with scripting, but I think it would be worth to experiment with it, because looking at most scripts, these could be easily transformed into a YAML/JSON/whatever file. Additionally, these files would nicely integrate into GUI (you could probably generate a GUI dialog by some scheme) and tooling, the user is able to define custom ones (like configs for items, weapons, levels, ...). I still have to think about this idea some more, but I think it'd be worth trying it out. That said, I'm open for other ideas or for hearing situations in which you would additionally want a scripting language. I'm going to write up the advantages of this approach in a few days.\r\n\r\nWith an example\r\n\r\n```\r\n// some_script.pseudo\r\n\r\nclass MySuperItem extends Item {\r\n    fn getTex() = \"items/super_item\";\r\n    fn getBlah() = \"Blah\";\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn on_init() {\r\n    register_item(MySuperItem);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, as config:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# super_item.yml\r\nname: MySuperItem\r\ntex: items/super_item\r\nblah: Blah\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@Xaeroxe and @lschmierer Discussed some ideas involving accesing components from a scripting language. Briefly mentioned is the feasablity of running the scripting system in parallel as an actual System.\r\nHowever this seems impractial due to the way `specs` enforces `SystemData` correctness on a type level.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things that need to be addressed, however, I think we should start with:\r\n- Are we going for a traditional scripting api, or with something

To demonstrate this I will use a mock class of what a **MeshInstance**, if made in Godot would look like.\r\n\r\n<details close>\r\n<summary>There is pseudo Unity, aka child nodes:</summary>\r\n<br>\r\nGodot users use child nodes to create a equivalent to MultiScripts.\r\n\r\nMeshInstance(Spatail +script)\r\n--- Mesh(Mesh +script)\r\n--- Material (node +script) - Shader (node +script) - Texture (node +script)\r\n--- Transform (Position3D +script) \r\n\r\nBasically they will use the most appropriate node and code what they need to create what class they want using a script.\r\n\r\n**Problems:**\r\n1.) It is the digital equivalent of adding cold water to a boiling pot; it helps short term but causes more confusion in larger projects.\r\n2.) Most users end up using signals like events, connecting them only to the node sending them and using **Export** to find the target.\r\n3.) Events can be intercepted before reaching the lower nodes.\r\n4.) Performance is slow and at around 50 000 object it can stall when the game tries to load scenes.\r\n</details>\r\n<details close>\r\n<summary>Pseudo Unreal, aka controllers and intermediate:</summary>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGodot users make controllers and possessor nodes that manipulate all the children. The trademark of this workflow is the classes derived with extends.\r\n\r\nMeshWithTexturedMaterial.instanced() *only node in tree\r\n-> extends from -> MaterialTextured -> extends from -> Material -> extends from -> Shader\r\n\r\nThis system requires heavy planing, or you end up with similar code in many classes. Like a camera, character and vehicle classes all containing their own copy of \"follow target\"\r\n**Problems:**\r\n1.) Messy large scripts that is a pain to debug.\r\n2.) Duplicate code in different classes.\r\n3.) Godot doesn't treat nodes as classes; forcing these developers to heavily relay on self coded classes.\r\n4.) Extends don't make sense, like a _combat system_ extending a _weapon system_ and finally extending the player.\r\n</details>\r\n<details close>\r\n<summary>Pseudo Panda3D, aka Preload(Script):</summary>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThis one replicates the workflow of how most code based engines work. The developers will often have more scripts than nodes.\r\n\r\nMeshInstance (Node)\r\nPreload (Mesh Script)\r\nPreload (Material Script)\r\nPreload  (Transform Script)\r\n\r\nStrangely it is these developers who refuse to abandon GDscript, even when C# is clearly better for this approach. That is why I assume they are familiar with Python.\r\n**Problems:**\r\n1.) Confusion on how imports should be called, as constants maybe variables with onready; who knows.\r\n2.) Rarely uses Godot nodes, I have even seen developers ignore the UI tools completely.\r\n3.) Pain to debug as there is no indication of where a script is linked.\r\n</details>\r\n<details close>\r\n<summary>WTF script:</summary>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nLeft the best for last. Some Godot game developers have managed to make good games using Signals and Groups.\r\n\r\nMeshInstance (Node) having a empty node on top allows for easy moving and re-design of the children.\r\n--- Mesh (Mesh +Script || Signal)\r\n--- Material (Sprite +Script || Signal)\r\n--- Transform (Position3D +Script || Signal)\r\n\r\nWhen the tree has to connect objects 2 scenes or more deep, a group will be used instead. Notable about this workflow is how it has shallow trees.\r\n**Problems:**\r\n1.) Signals and Groups allow for whole parts of the game to just fail, without as much as a warning.\r\n2.) Small pointless scripts just loitering around. All they do is send a signal and track a single value.\r\n3.) Moving a object with so many signals attached is frustrating in the least.\r\n4.) Conflicts with instance system. Because instances flow down while signal connect best up ward.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nYes, I know Godot has a **MeshInstance** class.\r\nThe point this demonstrates is that most of the workflows used by developers *right now* **can** make a class as complex as **MeshInstance** with multi components; except each workflow is seriously flawed.\r\n\r\nAll these work flows share the same core problem. They are short term solutions to developing a game.\r\nNone of them scales well and debug is flawed in all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Godot game developers needs from the Engine developers is a clear deceleration of what the official workflow is for making complex objects and systems.\r\nThat way they deviate but always know how it was intended to be used.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/7360","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/7360/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/7360/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/7360/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7360","id":599986789,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1OTk5ODY3ODk=","number":7360,"title":"\"undefined method `any?' for nil:NilClass\" during dependents check","user":{"login":"JustinTArthur","id":577312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzMxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/577312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinTArthur","html_url":"https://github.com/JustinTArthur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinTArthur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinTArthur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinTArthur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinTArthur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinTArthur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinTArthur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinTArthur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinTArthur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinTArthur/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":922544989,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MjI1NDQ5ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/labels/outdated","name":"outdated","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-04-14T16:57:19Z","updated_at":"2020-05-20T20:05:21Z","closed_at":"2020-04-15T10:13:02Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":"resolved","body":"# Please note we will close your issue without comment if you delete, do not read or do not fill out the issue checklist below and provide ALL the requested information.
