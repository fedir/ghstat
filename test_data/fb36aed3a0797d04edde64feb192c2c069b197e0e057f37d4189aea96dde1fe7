(.-hoplonKids this) nil)` on the element to nil. The newer version seems to no longer `set! .-hoplonKids` to nil anywhere.\r\n\r\nI've done a quick check where changing \r\nhttps://github.com/hoplon/hoplon/blob/7.2.0/src/hoplon/core.cljs#L428\r\nto look like the following seems to fix things:\r\n```\r\n(when-not (:static attrs)\r\n            (merge-kids helem nil nil)\r\n            (set! (.-hoplonKids helem) nil)\r\n            (add-attributes! helem attrs)\r\n            (add-children! helem kids))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's better to bring back the `remove-all-kids!` function or just put in the explicit `set!` call.

seen in chat are questions/confusion as to how Hoplon might perform.\n\nWhen I first started working with Hoplon, I assumed it was rebuilding a lot of the DOM quite frequently and was worried about how that might affect performance negatively.\n\nSince then I've learned a few things that make me feel more comfortable:\n- formula cells only recalculate when the cells they depend on change, so a lot of things will only recalculate infrequently (only when their dependencies change and this change propagates).\n- the DOM is actually largely static, `do!` handles most of the dynamism by adding watches whenever it is passed a cell. This means we can do things like caching the DOM (if we wanted to remove it and put it back).\n- there's work towards making non-static DOM behaviour a lot easier to handle in terms of memory management and caching, etc. at #93 \n- it's actually very easy to show/hide elements with `:toggle` in `do!`, and this solves many use-cases for wanting to add/remove elements to the DOM\n- calculating things \"in JS\" is faster than manipulating the DOM, so if you were writing code where you read-DOM->calculate->write-DOM repeatedly to the DOM previously, this is comparing apples to oranges when considering read-memory->calculate->write-changes-only-to-DOM style code.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/javelin/issues/12","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/javelin","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/javelin/issues/12/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/javelin/issues/12/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/javelin/issues/12/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hoplon/javelin/issues/12","id":27789284,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzc4OTI4NA==","number":12,"title":"Application slow on Ipad","user":{"login":"RSA199","id":5469879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Njk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5469879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSA199","html_url":"https://github.com/RSA199","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSA199/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSA199/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSA199/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSA199/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSA199/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSA199/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSA199/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSA199/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSA199/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-02-18T12:18:23Z","updated_at":"2017-12-29T12:01:42Z","closed_at":"2014-02-22T18:55:23Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I use to write applications Javelin and found a problem: dom element moves pretty slow, jerky.
