Q | A\r\n| --- | ---\r\n| Bug? | yes\r\n| New Feature? | no\r\n| Sulu Version | 1.5\r\n| Browser Version | Chrome 58\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen moving pages within the Sulu admin interface, the urls generated in the sitemap still show the old url for those pages (unless going to the page and save it again, then updates the url to the correct one).\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThese urls should be changed as well without any other additional steps.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWithin the Sulu admin interface:\r\n\r\n- Create a couple of pages `Page A` and `Page B`\r\n- Create some sub pages on each of those two pages\r\n- Move `Page B` into `Page A`\r\n- Generate a sitemap and you will see that the `Page B` and their subpages still have the old the url\r\n\r\n#### Possible Solutions \r\n\r\nOne solution that works is just to go to those pages and save them again one by one in the admin interface. That will update the url to the correct one. The problem with this solution is if the amount of pages is considerably high (like 400 pages)... then it becomes an extremely time consuming task.\r\n\r\n#### Questions\r\n\r\nGiven that we have two workspaces `default` and `default_live`:\r\n\r\nAfter some research (using a phpcr browser), we found that the moved nodes in the `default_live` workspace still got the value of the old url in the properties.

| Yes\r\n| New Feature? | no\r\n| Sulu Version | 1.2.1\r\n| Browser Version | Google Chrome Version 58.0.3024.0 (Offizieller Build) canary (64-Bit)\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nFor instance Sulu has 2 websites ( ex. `foo` website and `bar` website ). And During the user navigation, se_user_settings table saved the ColumnNavigationSelected key for `foo` website \r\nwith a content id which belongs to `bar`.  And Every time that user try to open `foo` website content on admin page, regarding to invalid `fooColumnNavigationSelected` ajax call having an empty response and javascript execution throw an error and stops the page loading. \r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nInvalid content id's should be handled both controller and javascript side.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIt is enough to change any ColumnNavigationSelected value on se_user_settings table for specific user and website. And When you click the 'content' submenu of the website with that user who has an invalid content id on ColumnNavigationSelected. Page generates a js error.\r\nFor instance;\r\n\r\n/admin/api/nodes/b93bfc70-8aea-46f5-9f12-ec718f4…DE&fields=title,order&exclude-ghosts=false&exclude-shadows=false&tree=true net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE\r\n\r\n#### Possible Solutions\r\n\r\nContent id validation is required for insertion of ColumnNavigationSelected to se_user_settings.\r\nIn case of invalid content id , controller should not response with empty body. And javascript should handle this error and load something like default content. \r\nMaybe it is also better to clean the invalid content id record on se_user_settings. \r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard/issues/803","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard/issues/803/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard/issues/803/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard/issues/803/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sulu/sulu-standard/issues/803","id":210069914,"number":803,"title":"Bug with ckeditor","user":{"login":"toxicity1985","id":708329,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/708329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toxicity1985","html_url":"https://github.com/toxicity1985","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toxicity1985/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toxicity1985/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toxicity1985/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toxicity1985/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toxicity1985/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toxicity1985/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toxicity1985/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toxicity1985/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toxicity1985/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48011467,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard/labels/Duplicate","name":"Duplicate","color":"ededed","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-02-24T15:00:29Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T06:35:26Z","closed_at":"2017-04-04T06:35:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"| Q | A\r\n| --- | ---\r\n| Bug? | yes\r\n| New Feature? | no\r\n| Sulu Version | Specific version or SHA of a commit\r\n| Browser Version | Browser name and version\r\n![screen shot 2017-02-24 at 15 59 55](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/708329/23308116/5822a778-faaa-11e6-91ac-01f32665e9f2.png)\r\n\r\nHello, i install sulu on dev server and i begin to put all the content.\r\nIt works well until i have this error and i cannot edit the content anymore\r\n\r\naura_1: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: Etiam porta sem malesuada magna mollis euismod.
