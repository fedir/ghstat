Ratpack provides at least a couple ways to accomplish this in a non-blocking manner.  One mechanism is through Ratpack Promise's internal trampoline.  It allows you to infinitely recurse without accumulating stack causing an overflow.  The problem with this approach is that Ratpack appears to maintain references to objects created during each iteration which prevents GC.  The end result is heap memory exhaustion.\r\n\r\nCreated the following project to demonstrate issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/jeff-blaisdell/ratpack-infinity\r\n\r\n### Example 1\r\n[InfinityRecursionAction](https://github.com/jeff-blaisdell/ratpack-infinity/blob/master/src/main/java/infinity/InfinityRecursionAction.java)\r\n\r\nA Ratpack Action that upon execution recursively iterates consequently producing an Out of Memory exception.\r\n\r\n### Example 2\r\n[InfinityForkAction](https://github.com/jeff-blaisdell/ratpack-infinity/blob/master/src/main/java/infinity/InfinityForkAction.java)\r\n\r\nA Ratpack Action that upon execution infinitely forks executions.  This performs as expected with memory allocated being appropriately GC'd after each iteration.\r\n\r\n### Observed Behavior\r\nRan test on both Ratpack 1.4.5 and 1.5.1.  Problem appears in both versions of Ratpack, 1.5.1\r\nappears to go a little longer before exhausting the heap.\r\n\r\n#### Infinite Forked Executions \r\nHeap memory is properly cleared on each iteration.\r\n[Download Heap Dump](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TlJJ4VPUr0vDD1vUFce8IrlAdy_q_AcY/view?usp=sharing)\r\n![Infinite Fork Heap](https://github.com/jeff-blaisdell/ratpack-infinity/blob/master/reports/ratpack-infinity-fork-heap.png?raw=true \"Infinite Fork Heap\")\r\n![Infinite Recursion Leak Suspect](https://github.com/jeff-blaisdell/ratpack-infinity/blob/master/reports/ratpack-infinity-fork-leak-suspect.png?raw=true \"Infinite Fork Leak Suspect\")\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Infinite Recursive Promises Executions\r\nHeap memory is leaked on each iteration.  The expectation here is that the internal trampoline\r\nof Ratpack's Promise should behave much like an iterable with the objects created and scoped within\r\nthe iteration becoming eligible for GC at the end of each iteration.\r\n[Download Heap Dump](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o39GYftb5R71hoEhfdDkwDilxOjyj_Qj/view?usp=sharing) \r\n![Infinite Recursion Heap](https://github.com/jeff-blaisdell/ratpack-infinity/blob/master/reports/ratpack-infinity-recursion-heap.png?raw=true \"Infinite Recursion Heap\")\r\n![Infinite Recursion Leak Suspect](https://github.com/jeff-blaisdell/ratpack-infinity/blob/master/reports/ratpack-infinity-recursion-leak-suspect.png?raw=true \"Infinite Recursion Leak Suspect\")\r\n![Infinite Recursion Dominator Tree](https://github.com/jeff-blaisdell/ratpack-infinity/blob/master/reports/ratpack-infinity-recursion-dominator-tree.png?raw=true \"Infinite Recursion Dominator Tree\")\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ratpack/ratpack/issues/1298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ratpack/ratpack","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ratpack/ratpack/issues/1298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ratpack/ratpack/issues/1298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ratpack/ratpack/issues/1298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/issues/1298","id":276889183,"number":1298,"title":"Upgrade to Jackson 2.8.9","user":{"login":"ldaley","id":17825,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley","html_url":"https://github.com/ldaley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"ldaley","id":17825,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley","html_url":"https://github.com/ldaley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ldaley","id":17825,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley","html_url":"https://github.com/ldaley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldaley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ratpack/ratpack/milestones/55","html_url":"https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/milestone/55","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ratpack/ratpack/milestones/55/labels","id":2876302,"number":55,"title":"release-1.5.1","description":"This release squashes a few bugs, updates some key libraries and most importantly brings compatibility with Gradle 4.2 and higher.\r\n\r\nPlease see the issue list below for details.
