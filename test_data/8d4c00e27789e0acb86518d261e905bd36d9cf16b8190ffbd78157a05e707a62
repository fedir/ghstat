Summary of issue\r\nRegistering a custom editor via the `EditorIsRendering` hook will give you a vue error on loading saying that `ckeditor.js` dependency wasn't found.\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.js:1607 [Vue warn]: Error in callback for watcher \"value\": \"ReferenceError: CKEDITOR is not defined\"\r\napp.js:2755 ReferenceError: CKEDITOR is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nI did exactly what is told here: [Hooks::EditorIsRendering](https://asgardcms.com/docs/v3/core-module/hooks#editor-is-rendering).\r\n\r\n* create an `EditorIsRendering` handler (look `LoadToastUIEditor`)\r\n* add handler to `wyswig-handler` config (look `core.php`)\r\n* visit a backend page with an editor field  (`localhost/backend/page/pages/1/edit` for eg)\r\n* look at the JS console and see loading the editor failing.\r\n\r\n**my custom editor files (for Toast UI Editor):**\r\n\r\n<details><summary>App\\Events\\Handlers\\LoadToastUIEditor</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\nnamespace App\\Events\\Handlers;\r\n\r\n\r\nuse

}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>config/asgard/core/core.php</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```php\r\n...\r\n   'wysiwyg-handler' => App\\Events\\Handlers\\LoadToastUIEditor::class\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System Details\r\n\r\n- Operating System: Linux/Ubuntu 16.04 (Docker)\r\n- PHP Version: 7.1\r\n- Laravel Version: 5.5.39\r\n- `Asgardcms/Platform` version: 3.0\r\n\r\n### Bug Breakdown\r\n\r\nThis error has it roots in the `Modules/Core/Assets/js/mixins/ActiveEditor.js` file which is imported to determine *vue component name* of the current editor.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default {\r\n    methods: {\r\n        getCurrentEditor() {\r\n            const configuredEditor = window.AsgardCMS.editor;\r\n            if (configuredEditor === 'simplemde') {\r\n                return 'markdown-editor';\r\n            }\r\n            if (configuredEditor === 'ckeditor') {\r\n                return 'ckeditor';\r\n            }\r\n            return 'ckeditor';\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see that `getCurrentEditor` only checks for `ckeditor` or `simplemde` and **will return `ckeditor` on default**.\r\n\r\nThis effectively prevents our custom editor from being loaded (it will always try to load the `ckeditor`).\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nWe can fix this error by just letting `getCurrentEditor` return our editor name as component name on default.\r\n\r\n* let `getCurrentEditor()` return `window.AsgardCMS.editor` on default\r\n* add `undefined` check and return `ckeditor` as fallback\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nexport default {\r\n    methods: {\r\n        getCurrentEditor() {\r\n            const configuredEditor = window.AsgardCMS.editor;\r\n            if (configuredEditor === 'simplemde') {\r\n                return 'markdown-editor';\r\n            }\r\n-            if (configuredEditor === 'ckeditor') {\r\n+           if (configuredEditor === 'ckeditor' || configuredEditor === undefined) {\r\n                return 'ckeditor';\r\n            }\r\n-            return 'ckeditor';\r\n+           return configuredEditor;\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n> NOTE: My example script will still not work after this patch because we didn't register the vue component itself. Add this step to the AsgardCms documentation at the Hooks::EditorIsRendering section for completion.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AsgardCms/Platform/issues/502","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AsgardCms/Platform","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AsgardCms/Platform/issues/502/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AsgardCms/Platform/issues/502/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AsgardCms/Platform/issues/502/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AsgardCms/Platform/issues/502","id":309126357,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMDkxMjYzNTc=","number":502,"title":"[Menu] Menus not displaying active state when default lang is hidden","user":{"login":"kamekun","id":4941976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4941976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamekun","html_url":"https://github.com/kamekun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamekun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamekun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamekun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamekun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamekun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamekun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamekun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamekun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamekun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-03-27T20:43:15Z","updated_at":"2018-05-20T14:39:39Z","closed_at":"2018-05-01T19:52:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Summary of issue\r\nHi i found a bug with the module menu, when i  set the `hideDefaultLocaleInURL` to true, and the default lang is hide, the active lang dont recognize the active menu option. on the Menu::get('main'), if i leave it as false, it work normal.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\nGo to config `Laravellocalization.php` and set the option `hideDefaultLocaleInURL` to true, go to your front-end  and get your menu with  `{!!

Whenever I write some text in the source editor, the page won't save the new text. Only the old editor content is POSTed, although I get the notification that the page was saved successfully. However, this problem does not occur when I type in the visual editor, only when writing in the source. My guess is that it has something to do with the editor not triggering document.write() when using only the source editor, which causes the POST request to get the old data. A workaround to this is to write the text in the source editor and in order to save it, write something in the visual editor just to trigger the write() method. This way the POST request will contain the pasted text.\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n-\tOpen a page, write some text in the CKEditor, in Source.\r\n-\tSave the page and reopen it\r\n-\tThe editor will show the old content\r\n\r\nThis problem occurs even in a fresh Asgard installation.\r\n### System Details\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04.1\r\n- PHP Version: 7.1.15\r\n- Laravel Version: 5.5.36\r\n- `Asgardcms/Platform` version: 3\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AsgardCms/Platform/issues/494","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AsgardCms/Platform","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AsgardCms/Platform/issues/494/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AsgardCms/Platform/issues/494/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AsgardCms/Platform/issues/494/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AsgardCms/Platform/issues/494","id":305350374,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMDUzNTAzNzQ=","number":494,"title":"Illuminate\\Database\\QueryException  : SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1215 Cannot add foreign key constraint...","user":{"login":"olegshepel","id":26865194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODY1MTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26865194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegshepel","html_url":"https://github.com/olegshepel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegshepel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegshepel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegshepel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegshepel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegshepel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegshepel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegshepel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegshepel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegshepel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-03-14T22:23:14Z","updated_at":"2018-05-05T15:46:28Z","closed_at":"2018-05-05T15:46:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, my problem is trying to make command: \"php artisan migrate\" in 1 version evething is ok:\r\npublic function up()\r\n    {\r\n        Schema::create('companies', function (Blueprint $table) {\r\n            $table->increments('id');\r\n            $table->text('company_id');\r\n            $table->text('company_name');\r\n            $table->boolean('company_verify')->default(0);\r\n            $table->timestamps();\r\n            $table->integer('user_id')->unsigned()->nullable();\r\n            $table->integer('email_id')->unsigned()->nullable();\r\n            $table->integer('phone_id')->unsigned()->nullable();\r\n        });\r\n        //Schema::enableForeignKeyConstraints();\r\n        Schema::table('companies', function (Blueprint $table) {\r\n            $table->foreign('user_id')->references('id')->on('users')\r\n                    ->onUpdate('cascade')->onDelete(NULL);\r\n//            $table->foreign('email_id')->references('id')->on('emails')\r\n//                    ->onUpdate('cascade')->onDelete(NULL);\r\n//            $table->foreign('phone_id')->references('id')->on('phones')\r\n//                    ->onUpdate('cascade')->onDelete(NULL);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\nBut once uncomment: foreign key for email_id and phone_id (even only email_id) the error: Illuminate\\Database\\QueryException  : SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1215 Cannot add foreign key constraint (SQL: alter table `companies` add constraint `companies_email_id_foreign` foreign key (`email_id`) references `emails` (`id`) on update cascade).

I am a web developer by profession and an experienced Filipino translator - these are on top of being an experienced web developer with more than 6 years of experience and specialized in the following scripting languages and technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, JQUERY, PHP, WORDPRESS and CONCRETE5). This means I know which codes are to be translated, and which ones that are to remain as it is. I am a strong advocate of thought-by-thought instead of word-by-word style of doing the translations, and I am carefully strict in grammars and spellings and proper word conjugations of my languages, Filipino and Tagalog.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you soon and work with you in the translations. You can count on me that I will do my job with utmost dedication.
