Remove SYS_TABLESPACES and SYS_DATAFILES\n\nThe InnoDB internal tables SYS_TABLESPACES and SYS_DATAFILES as well as the\nINFORMATION_SCHEMA views INNODB_SYS_TABLESPACES and INNODB_SYS_DATAFILES\nwere introduced in MySQL 5.6 for no good reason in\nmysql/mysql-server/commit/e9255a22ef16d612a8076bc0b34002bc5a784627\nwhen the InnoDB support for the DATA DIRECTORY attribute was introduced.\n\nThe file system should be the authoritative source of information on files.\nStoring information about file system paths in the file system (symlinks,\nor even the .isl files that were unfortunately chosen as the solution) is\nsufficient. If information is additionally stored in some hidden tables\ninside the InnoDB system tablespace, everything unnecessarily becomes\nmore complicated, because more copies of data mean more opportunity\nfor the copies to be out of sync, and because modifying the data in\nthe system tablespace in the desired way might not be possible at all\nwithout modifying the InnoDB source code. So, the copy in the system\ntablespace basically is a redundant, non-authoritative source of\ninformation.\n\nWe will stop creating or accessing the system tables SYS_TABLESPACES\nand SYS_DATAFILES.\n\nWe will also remove the view\nINFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_SYS_DATAFILES along with SYS_DATAFILES.\n\nThe view\nINFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_SYS_TABLESPACES will be repurposed\nto directly reflect fil_system.space_list. The column\nPAGE_SIZE, which would always contain the value of\nthe GLOBAL read-only variable innodb_page_size, is\nremoved. The column ZIP_PAGE_SIZE, which would actually\ncontain the physical page size of a page, is renamed to\nPAGE_SIZE. Finally, a new column FILENAME is added, as a\nreplacement of SYS_DATAFILES.PATH.\n\nThis will also\naddress MDEV-21801 (files that were created before upgrading\nto MySQL 5.6 or MariaDB 10.0 or later were never registered\nin SYS_TABLESPACES or SYS_DATAFILES) and\nMDEV-21801 (information about the system tablespace is not stored\nin SYS_TABLESPACES or SYS_DATAFILES).","tree":{"sha":"ac30d7e0ba8501683cff593ae523035a3a8b3b4a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MariaDB/server/git/trees/ac30d7e0ba8501683cff593ae523035a3a8b3b4a"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MariaDB/server/git/commits/5407117a59a87a1e0042581bc9c258cd2e743c85","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MariaDB/server/commits/5407117a59a87a1e0042581bc9c258cd2e743c85","html_url":"https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/5407117a59a87a1e0042581bc9c258cd2e743c85","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MariaDB/server/commits/5407117a59a87a1e0042581bc9c258cd2e743c85/comments","author":{"login":"dr-m","id":20552695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTUyNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20552695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m","html_url":"https://github.com/dr-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"dr-m","id":20552695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTUyNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20552695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m","html_url":"https://github.com/dr-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-m/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"9bc874a594edbc0e124131d0ff30b44f5fade52d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MariaDB/server/commits/9bc874a594edbc0e124131d0ff30b44f5fade52d","html_url":"https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/9bc874a594edbc0e124131d0ff30b44f5fade52d"}]},{"sha":"9bc874a594edbc0e124131d0ff30b44f5fade52d","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTk4MTYwNzA6OWJjODc0YTU5NGVkYmMwZTEyNDEzMWQwZmYzMGI0NGY1ZmFkZTUyZA==","commit":{"author":{"name":"Marko Mäkelä","email":"marko.makela@mariadb.com","date":"2020-11-10T15:21:16Z"},"committer":{"name":"Marko Mäkelä","email":"marko.makela@mariadb.com","date":"2020-11-11T09:15:11Z"},"message":"MDEV-23497 Make ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED read-only by default\n\nLet us introduce the parameter innodb_read_only_compressed\nthat is ON by default, making any ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED tables\nread-only.\n\nI developed the ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED format based on\nHeikki Tuuri's rough design between 2005 and 2008.
