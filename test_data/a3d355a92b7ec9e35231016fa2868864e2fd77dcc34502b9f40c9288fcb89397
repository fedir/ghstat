To prevent\nresource exhaustion leading to poor performance. According\nto Travis docs, a max of 4 concurrent processses should be\nrun per job:\nhttps://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#My-build-script-is-killed-without-any-error\n\n* Reconsider tests exec order and split huge main and rocksdb\ntest suites into their own job, decreasing the chance of going\nover the Travis job execution limit and getting killed;\n\n* Increase Travis testcase-timeout to 4 minutes. Occasionally\non Ubuntu target and frequently on macOS, many tests in main,\nrpl, binlog suites take longer than 2 minutes, resulting in\nmany jobs failing, when in reality the failing tests didn't\nget a chance to complete. From my testing, along with the other\nspeedups, i.e. increasing ccache size, a timeout of 4 minutes\nshould be Ok.  Revert to 3 minutes of necessary.\n\n* Build with GCC and Clang version 5,6 only.\n\n* Rename GCC_VERSION to CC_VERSION for clarity. We are using\ntwo compilers after all, GCC and Clang.\n\n* Stop using somewhat obsolete Clang4 in Travis.
