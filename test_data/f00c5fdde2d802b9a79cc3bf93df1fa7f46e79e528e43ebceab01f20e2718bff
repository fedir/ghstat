This gets\nrid of at least one integer division per call, and it eliminates\nsome apparently-easy-to-mess-up arithmetic.\n\nTwo of these call sites were in fact wrong:\n\n* pg_prewarm's autoprewarm_main() forgot to multiply the seconds\nby 1000, thus ending up with a delay 1000X shorter than intended.\nThat doesn't quite make it a busy-wait, but close.\n\n* postgres_fdw's pgfdw_get_cleanup_result() thought it needed to compute\nmicroseconds not milliseconds, thus ending up with a delay 1000X longer\nthan intended.  Somebody along the way had noticed this problem but\nmisdiagnosed the cause, and imposed an ad-hoc 60-second limit rather\nthan fixing the units.  This was relatively harmless in context, because\nwe don't care that much about exactly how long this delay is; still,\nit's wrong.\n\nThere are a few more callers of TimestampDifference() that don't\nhave a direct need for seconds-and-microseconds, but can't use\nTimestampDifferenceMilliseconds() either because they do need\nmicrosecond precision or because they might possibly deal with\nintervals long enough to overflow 32-bit milliseconds.
