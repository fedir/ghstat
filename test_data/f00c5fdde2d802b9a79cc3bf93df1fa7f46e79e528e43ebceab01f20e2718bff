A lot of cross-checks happen in MergeAttributes() which is\nnot designed for this purpose, so the tests added in this commit will\nmake sure that any kind of future refactoring will limit the amount of\ncompatibility breakage.\n\nAuthor: Michael Paquier\nReviewed-by: Ashutosh Bapat\nDiscussion: https://postgr.es/m/20180619022131.GE3314@paquier.xyz","tree":{"sha":"05b8b0f74e36bc90222dc300e9943df92c4478ed","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/postgres/postgres/git/trees/05b8b0f74e36bc90222dc300e9943df92c4478ed"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/postgres/postgres/git/commits/9994013ff32cb8371aed8ba28fc262e0a8cb0b4b","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/postgres/postgres/commits/9994013ff32cb8371aed8ba28fc262e0a8cb0b4b","html_url":"https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/9994013ff32cb8371aed8ba28fc262e0a8cb0b4b","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/postgres/postgres/commits/9994013ff32cb8371aed8ba28fc262e0a8cb0b4b/comments","author":{"login":"michaelpq","id":985332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTMzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/985332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelpq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"michaelpq","id":985332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTMzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/985332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelpq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"c4309f4aeeae54e4c5281d68e29288af1d0d1ed2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/postgres/postgres/commits/c4309f4aeeae54e4c5281d68e29288af1d0d1ed2","html_url":"https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/c4309f4aeeae54e4c5281d68e29288af1d0d1ed2"}]},{"sha":"c4309f4aeeae54e4c5281d68e29288af1d0d1ed2","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0OTI3NDQyOmM0MzA5ZjRhZWVhZTU0ZTRjNTI4MWQ2OGUyOTI4OGFmMWQwZDFlZDI=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Peter Eisentraut","email":"peter_e@gmx.net","date":"2018-05-22T18:25:01Z"},"committer":{"name":"Peter Eisentraut","email":"peter_e@gmx.net","date":"2018-07-01T10:58:32Z"},"message":"Use $Test::Builder::Level in TAP test functions\n\nIn TAP test functions, that is, those that produce test results, locally\nincrement $Test::Builder::Level.

snapshot handling in logical decoding\n\nTwo closely related bugs are fixed.  First, xmin of logical slots was\nadvanced too early.  During xl_running_xacts processing, xmin of the\nslot was set to the oldest running xid in the record, but that's wrong:\nactually, snapshots which will be used for not-yet-replayed transactions\nmight consider older txns as running too, so we need to keep xmin back\nfor them.  The problem wasn't noticed earlier because DDL which allows\nto delete tuple (set xmax) while some another not-yet-committed\ntransaction looks at it is pretty rare, if not unique: e.g. all forms of\nALTER TABLE which change schema acquire ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock\nconflicting with any inserts. The included test case (test_decoding's\noldest_xmin) uses ALTER of a composite type, which doesn't have such\ninterlocking.\n\nTo deal with this, we must be able to quickly retrieve oldest xmin\n(oldest running xid among all assigned snapshots) from ReorderBuffer. To\nfix, add another list of ReorderBufferTXNs to the reorderbuffer, where\ntransactions are sorted by base-snapshot-LSN.  This is slightly\ndifferent from the existing (sorted by first-LSN) list, because a\ntransaction can have an earlier LSN but a later Xmin, if its first\nrecord does not obtain an xmin (eg. xl_xact_assignment).  Note this new\nlist doesn't fully replace the existing txn list: we still need that one\nto prevent WAL recycling.\n\nThe second issue concerns SnapBuilder snapshots and subtransactions.\nSnapBuildDistributeNewCatalogSnapshot never assigned a snapshot to a\ntransaction that is known to be a subtxn, which is good in the common\ncase that the top-level transaction already has one (no point in doing\nso), but a bug otherwise.  To fix, arrange to transfer the snapshot from\nthe subtxn to its top-level txn as soon as the kinship gets known.\ntest_decoding's snapshot_transfer verifies this.\n\nAlso, fix a minor memory leak: refcount of toplevel's old base snapshot\nwas not decremented when the snapshot is transferred from child.\n\nLiberally sprinkle code comments, and rewrite a few existing ones.  This\npart is my (Álvaro's) contribution to this commit, as I had to write all\nthose comments in order to understand the existing code and Arseny's\npatch.\n\nReported-by: Arseny Sher <a.sher@postgrespro.ru>\nDiagnosed-by: Arseny Sher <a.sher@postgrespro.ru>\nCo-authored-by: Arseny Sher <a.sher@postgrespro.ru>\nCo-authored-by: Álvaro Herrera <alvherre@alvh.no-ip.org>\nReviewed-by: Antonin Houska <ah@cybertec.at>\nDiscussion: https://postgr.es/m/87lgdyz1wj.fsf@ars-thinkpad","tree":{"sha":"1820c0acefa4744043ea48c3876c3029a1e26aaf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/postgres/postgres/git/trees/1820c0acefa4744043ea48c3876c3029a1e26aaf"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/postgres/postgres/git/commits/f49a80c481f74fa81407dce8e51dea6956cb64f8","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/postgres/postgres/commits/f49a80c481f74fa81407dce8e51dea6956cb64f8","html_url":"https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/f49a80c481f74fa81407dce8e51dea6956cb64f8","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/postgres/postgres/commits/f49a80c481f74fa81407dce8e51dea6956cb64f8/comments","author":{"login":"alvherre","id":340005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDAwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/340005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre","html_url":"https://github.com/alvherre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"alvherre","id":340005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDAwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/340005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre","html_url":"https://github.com/alvherre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvherre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"4d54543efa5eb074ead4d0fadb2af4161c943044","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/postgres/postgres/commits/4d54543efa5eb074ead4d0fadb2af4161c943044","html_url":"https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/4d54543efa5eb074ead4d0fadb2af4161c943044"}]},{"sha":"4d54543efa5eb074ead4d0fadb2af4161c943044","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0OTI3NDQyOjRkNTQ1NDNlZmE1ZWIwNzRlYWQ0ZDBmYWRiMmFmNDE2MWM5NDMwNDQ=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Alexander Korotkov","email":"akorotkov@postgresql.org","date":"2018-06-26T18:55:59Z"},"committer":{"name":"Alexander Korotkov","email":"akorotkov@postgresql.org","date":"2018-06-26T18:55:59Z"},"message":"Fix upper limit for vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor\n\n6ca33a88 sets upper limit for vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor to\nDBL_MAX.
