In some cases, it might either be inappropriate or highly inefficient for the client to send the body if the server will reject the message without looking at the body.\n\nIn my case, for example, I can upload file or reject already uploaded file in one atomic request.\n\nCurrent state:\n- 0.9.x - handler can make desigion and allow/reject client request by additional `check_continue` method. This method is not supported by https://github.com/iron/iron and https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs. Also this method require duplicate logic (it not called on HTTP/1.0) for routing and check permissions;\n- master - looks like this feature is forgotten.\n\nI think, much better to send \"100 Continue\" status on first Body::read() call (similar logic implemented by https://github.com/frewsxcv/tiny-http project).\n\nIn this case no additional logic/callback needed for make desigion about \"100 Continue\":\n- If you call Body::read() method, then you needs to request body and hyper send to client \"100 Continue\";\n- If you have anought information to send final status without body, then hyper send status without \"100 Continue\".\n\nI try to change logic on 0.9.x branch by send \"100 Continue\" status of first read call, but I failed

recently updated my Homebrew Rust installation to 1.2.0. Everything works great, except that when I use Cargo in a project which depends on the glium crate I encounter a stack overflow error. See https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1907.\n\nThis issue was discovered a few days ago (when depending on a different crate) and subsequently fixed upstream. See https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1875 and its resolution https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/1887. I'm not familiar with Homebrew's policies with regard to backporting upstream fixes but I consider the 1.2.0 release of cargo to be broken and (for my purposes) unusable due to this issue.
