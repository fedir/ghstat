think I made a mistake. If you can't read Chinese, we can discuss it in google doc.**\r\n\r\nEnglish: \r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1eA47QN3vkBS4fj7PZQJVBeYiSO73ceelzRSRiTc8Em4/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nChinese:\r\n\r\n# 版本维护计划\r\n## 1.x 版本\r\n我们将持续维护 1.x 版本。这种维护是指：\r\n1. 如果用户提交了 PR，无论是修复 BUG 还是提供新的特性的支持，我们都会将其合并进来，并且在一段时间后发版本；\r\n2. 某些影响重大的 BUG，我们会考虑自己修复。但是不提供任何新功能的支持；\r\n当我们认为2.x版本已经足够稳定之后（通常意味着 2.1.0 版本发布），我们会彻底放弃维护这个版本。\r\n## 2.0.x 版本 （暂定截止2020年底）\r\n这一系列的版本可以看做是过渡版本，即从 1.x 过渡到 2.x 的版本。同时也可以看做我们持续重构的中间版本。在这些版本中，每完成一个部分的重构，我们就会发布一个小版本。\r\n该版本还有一个特性，就是这个版本里面会有很多兼容性的代码，即为了兼容 1.x 版本的遗留代码。\r\n\r\n**该版本的另外一个重要特性是，我们会新支持很多近两年出来的框架，特别是云相关的框架，以方便用户引领云原生时代浪潮。**\r\n\r\n\r\n目前规划中的版本：\r\n### 2.0.0\r\n2.0.0 作为第一个重构的版本，它的主要任务在于：\r\n1. 为后续的版本提供支持，如支持context.Context，重新设计web的中间件机制；\r\n2. 增加对新的框架（中间件）的支持，以吸引用户逐步切换到v2版本。首要目标是完成对可观测性中间件的支持，即metrics和tracing两个方面的支持；\r\n3. 设计模块化API。我们将这一次预备支持的metrics和tracing设计为一个可插拔的模块。\r\n\r\n### 2.0.1\r\n1. grpc支持，方案待确定；\r\n2. 拆分日志组件。设计一套API作为统一的日志API（或者使用开源的API），而后将已有的日志组件作为默认实现，拆分成单独的项目。同时，提供主流日志框架的adapter实现，如zap。这部分将鼓励社区贡献对不同日志框架的适配；\r\n3. 优化web路由。设计路由API，并且提供两种默认实现；一种是支持各种复杂匹配的，以易用性为主要目标的实现；一种是以性能为主要目标，支持复杂度有限的路由匹配；\r\n4. 设计ORM API，将已有的ORM作为默认实现，提供对gorm的适配。\r\n\r\n### 2.0.2-2.0.3\r\n待定。逐步将所有的模块转化可插拔的模块。\r\n\r\n### 2.0.4——拆分兼容性代码\r\n在这个版本之前，我们会在Beego里面保留所有的兼容1.x的代码。而在这个版本之后，所有的兼容性代码都被拆分到了 Beego-1.x-adapter。\r\n以上所有版本，都会穿插支持更多的中间件或者第三方库。这些新支持的东西，将不会提供 1.x 版本的兼容性代码。意味着，新功能 1.x 版本将完全无法使用。我们将通过这种做法，引导用户逐步切换到 2.x 版本。\r\n\r\n## 2.1.x 版本\r\n2.1.0 版本可以看做是完成重构之后的第一个大版本。这个版本我们将达成以下目标：\r\n1. 完成了模块化的改造。这个阶段的产物有：\r\n    - Beego 项目。作为用户主要使用的项目。它集成了各个模块的默认实现，可以做到开箱即用。\r\n    - 各个模块。我们将各个模块都单独拆出去了，每个模块都含有一套标准 API，和多个默认实现。即便用户不选择使用 Beego，但是这些模块他们依旧可以拿去他自己的项目里面使用\r\n    - Beego-1.x-adapter。实际上这个东西应该是 2.0.x 最后一个版本的产物，用户可以引入这个模块以兼容 1.x 版本。我们在 2.1.x 的时候还会保留一小段时间。\r\n2. 完全的云原生支持，Beego 将具备构建基于 HTTP 协议或者 RPC 协议的大型系统的能力；","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bccp/nbodykit/issues/639","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bccp/nbodykit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bccp/nbodykit/issues/639/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bccp/nbodykit/issues/639/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bccp/nbodykit/issues/639/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bccp/nbodykit/issues/639","id":693957486,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2OTM5NTc0ODY=","number":639,"title":"How to save mesh to a '.dat' binary file?","user":{"login":"WangYun1995","id":68187127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTg3MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/68187127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangYun1995","html_url":"https://github.com/WangYun1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangYun1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangYun1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangYun1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangYun1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangYun1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangYun1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangYun1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangYun1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangYun1995/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":18,"created_at":"2020-09-05T03:33:49Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T07:39:13Z","closed_at":"2020-09-21T07:39:13Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"According to nbodykit documentation, I know how to save a mesh to a bigfile, using the code as follows.\r\n`mesh.save('filename.bigfile', mode='real', dataset='Field')`\r\nHowever, how should I do for saving mesh to a '.dat' binary file?\r\n\r\n`mesh.save('filename.dat`, mode='real', dataset='Field')`\r\nDoes that work?","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/crewjam/saml/issues/271","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/crewjam/saml","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/crewjam/saml/issues/271/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/crewjam/saml/issues/271/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/crewjam/saml/issues/271/events","html_url":"https://github.com/crewjam/saml/issues/271","id":572032351,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NzIwMzIzNTE=","number":271,"title":"Integrate to Revel framework","user":{"login":"GururajaUN","id":12933049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMzMDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12933049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GururajaUN","html_url":"https://github.com/GururajaUN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GururajaUN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GururajaUN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GururajaUN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GururajaUN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GururajaUN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GururajaUN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GururajaUN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GururajaUN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GururajaUN/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-02-27T11:55:27Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T06:31:44Z","closed_at":"2020-04-15T06:31:43Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I am successfully able to execute the example \"trivial.go\" as SP against my Okta IDP .\r\n\r\nI am trying to integrate this package to the Revel application we have so that we can authenticate users against the Okta IDP.
