It could be helpful in certain cases to disable this behaviour, for example, when a user wishes just to exam only the official Go standard library documentation and not EVERYTHING they currently have in their source folder. This would be helpful when a user is trying to learn Go by reading the official documentation in an offline mode by using \"godoc -http\". The current behaviour makes readability quite poor if the user has a large number of packages installed and is primarily interested in only the official documentation.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the user's $GOPATH environment variable can't even be used to temporarily override this default behaviour, for example:\r\n\r\n`~$ GOPATH=\"\" godoc -http`\r\n\r\nThis example command line fails because build.Default.GOPATH adds Go's default GOPATH value regardless.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nRather than suggest a change to the build context default, I'm proposing that a flag be added to the godoc cmd that enables a user to simply exclude the GOPATH source files from a godoc command session.\r\n\r\nThe following lines would be added to / changed in main.go:\r\n\r\n`excludeGopath    = flag.Bool(\"exclude_gopath\", false, \"exclude packages in $GOPATH\")`\r\n\r\n```\r\nif !*excludeGoPath {\r\n\t// Bind $GOPATH trees into Go root.\r\n\tfor _, p := range filepath.SplitList(build.Default.GOPATH) {\r\n\t\tfs.Bind(\"/src\", gatefs.New(vfs.OS(p), fsGate), \"/src\", vfs.BindAfter)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis proposal avoids any platform specific issues by simply entirely bypassing the processing of that path. If any future changes were to the underling default context to better support this behaviour it could easily be rolled back.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\nIf this proposed change is accepted then I'd naturally be happy to write it up.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/25363","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/25363/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/25363/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/25363/events","html_url":"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/25363","id":322556558,"number":25363,"title":"Add implementation of h2c into x/net/http2/h2c.","user":{"login":"misterwilliam","id":164604,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/164604?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterwilliam","html_url":"https://github.com/misterwilliam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterwilliam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterwilliam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterwilliam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterwilliam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterwilliam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterwilliam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterwilliam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterwilliam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterwilliam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-05-13T01:47:11Z","updated_at":"2018-05-13T04:34:03Z","closed_at":"2018-05-13T04:34:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I would like to add an implementation of h2c into x/net/http2/h2c.\r\n\r\nThe proposed implementation strategy is to implement h2c by leveraging the existing http2.Server by implementing the 2 ways to start an h2c connection as described in RFC 7540, which are: (1)\r\ncreate a connection starting with HTTP/1 and then upgrading to h2c [Section 3.2] and (2) starting a connection directly speaking h2c (aka starting with prior knowledge) [Section 3.4].\r\n\r\nFor both of the above connection methods the implementation strategy is to hijack a HTTP/1 connection, perform the h2c connection on the hijacked net.Conn, and create a suitably configured net.Conn to pass into http2.Server.ServeConn.\r\n\r\nFor h2c with prior knowledge this is relatively simple. For that we just have to verify the HTTP/2 client preface has been written to the net.Conn, and then reforward the client preface to the hijacked connection.\r\n\r\nFor h2c upgraded from HTTP/1, this is a bit more involved. First we validate the HTTP/1 Upgrade request, and respond to the client with 101 Switching Protocols. Then we write a HTTP/2 client preface on behalf of the client, and a settings frame and a headers frame which correspond to what was in\r\nthe upgrade request. Then since http2.Server is going respond with a settings ACK, we swallow it so that it is not forwarded to the client since for h2c upgrade from HTTP/1 the 101 Switching Protocols response replaces the settings ACK.\r\n\r\nI have a working example of this strategy submitted to gerrit as: 112997\r\n\r\nThe code I have will obviously need some work before submission, but I think I am far enough that I would like to start the conversation on what the next steps should be. (This is my first time trying to contribute, so I'm a little confused what the process is. I am under the impression that I should get some feedback on my proposal before trying to produce the final solution.)\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/25362","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/25362/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/25362/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/25362/events","html_url":"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/25362","id":322502887,"number":25362,"title":"godoc: confuse","user":{"login":"Konstantin8105","id":16690032,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16690032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Konstantin8105","html_url":"https://github.com/Konstantin8105","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Konstantin8105/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Konstantin8105/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Konstantin8105/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Konstantin8105/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Konstantin8105/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Konstantin8105/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Konstantin8105/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Konstantin8105/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Konstantin8105/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-05-12T11:11:08Z","updated_at":"2018-05-12T20:50:27Z","closed_at":"2018-05-12T20:50:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Godoc confuse.

Whether an error is signaled depends on how the underlying `Reader` segments its output. If its final read is aligned to a 4-byte boundary and contains only the final unpadded block, then the package does the (IMO) right thing and returns `io.UnexpectedEOF`. But otherwise, then the package silently ignores the extraneous characters and returns `io.EOF` (i.e., successful completion of decoding).\r\n\r\nThe example program demonstrates this with the 18-byte input `\"NBSWY3DPO5XXE3DEZZ\"`. When the final read is of `\"ZZ\"`, it returns `io.UnexpectedEOF`. But when the final read is `\"EZZ\"`, `\"DEZZ\"`, or anything else, it returns `io.EOF`. I would expect it to return `io.UnexpectedEOF` in all cases. (A case could be made for returning `base32.CorruptInputError`, like `base32.DecodeString` does, but at any rate the error should be something other than `io.EOF`.)\r\n\r\nThis bug was [originally reported](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/EwVwOPDnG8w/5M2retkiO8sJ) on golang-nuts, in 2014 for go1.3.2. There was some discussion but it never got fixed.

`NewEncoder`/`Write`/`Close` differ from `Encode`/`EncodeToString` when using an `Encoding` that has `NoPadding` set. `Encode`/`EncodeToString` correctly truncate the string at the point where padding characters would appear. `NewEncoder`/`Write`/`Close` always write a multiple of 8 bytes, as if padding with `'A'`, which leads to spurious trailing `'\\x00'` bytes after decoding.\r\n\r\nI think the bug lies in [`encoder.Close`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b53088a63436ac49d2344a733a50d529b5f7244e/src/encoding/base32/base32.go#L241-L251): it doesn't know about `NoPadding`, always outputting either 0 or 8 bytes.\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n`go version go1.10.1 linux/amd64`\r\n\r\n### Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?\r\n\r\nYes
