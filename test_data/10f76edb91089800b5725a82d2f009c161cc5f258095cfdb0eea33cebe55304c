earlier versions of Ember, inputs had a bug where certain event names could not be referenced as they were documented in the Guides, such as `<Textarea @focus-in={{this.didFocusIn}} />`. This has been fixed now! We should update the Guides to make sure they give the correct guidance. This issue is recommended for writers with some past technical writing experience or past contributions to Ember's documentation.\r\n\r\nTo-do:\r\n- Try out the event passing like `@focus-in` in the latest stable version of Ember and confirm that it works\r\n- Read over https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/built-in-components/ and see which examples/explanations should be updated. It is possible that no changes are needed, since the source of the confusion was that the Guides said something should work that didn't, and now there's a bugfix. If that's the case, please comment on this issue.\r\n- Feel free to open Issues for anything else you notice along the way that needs fixing\r\n- Reach out to the learning team on #dev-ember-learning if you have questions.\r\n\r\nFor reference:\r\n- Read past discussion here https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/18654\r\n- Bugfix 1 https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/18997\r\n- Bugfix 2 https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/19001\r\n\r\nNote that there are still some complexities that are _not bugs_ which remain, such as understanding how action, fn, and modifiers fit into this story. Those are out of scope for this issue, since our first step should always be to make sure that the Guides are correct. If you are on a roll and want to tackle that too, go for it!

This is intended for performing object-model level cleanup.\r\n\r\nthen, in the following code example:\r\n```ts\r\n destroyModifier(instance, args) {\r\n    if (instance.willDestroyDOM !== undefined) {\r\n      instance.willDestroyDOM();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nargs are passed to `destroyModifier`.\r\n\r\nI think this is a bug because:\r\n -

none of the above issues exist anymore\r\n  - teardown is slightly faster due to not re-consuming args\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nFor example, today, the following isn't safe:\r\n\r\n```hbs\r\n{{#if this.data.foo}}\r\n  <SomeComponent @data={{this.data}} />\r\n{{/if}}\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\n// some-component\r\nexport default setComponentTemplate(hbs`\r\n  <span {{some-modifier this.nestedData}}>breaks</span>\r\n`, class extends Component {\r\n  get nestedData() {\r\n    // you should be able to assume foo exists, because of the condition in the previous template\r\n    // but today, you can't assume that :(\r\n    return this.args.data.foo.dataOnFoo;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nMinimal Reproduction / Description of the Problem: https://ember-twiddle.com/5a3fa797b26e8807869340792219a5ee?openFiles=components.demo%5C.hbs%2Ccomponents.demo%5C.hbs\r\n\r\nRelevant Discord Threads:\r\n -

a bug in ember-simple-set-helper since it uses a custom AST transform, which is likely now broken. The AST has changed a decent amount in this VM upgrade.\r\n\r\n> Edit: For context, the AST is not considered public API and changes like this are considered to be within semver.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've found an issue which was introduced with the Glimmer VM upgrade in [v3.17.0-beta.1 ](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v3.17.0-beta.1). The only changelog item in that release is:\r\n\r\n> #18688 / #18621 Updates Glimmer-VM to v0.46\r\n\r\nTo reproduce we have the following code where we pass the `set` action an object property to a child component and then set the property in the child:\r\n\r\n```hbs\r\n{{!-- app/templates/components/parent.hbs --}}\r\n<Child @onChange={{set @user.name}} />\r\n\r\n{{!-- app/templates/components/child.hbs --}}\r\n<button type=\"button\" {{on \"click\" (fn @onChange \"Bob\")}}>Click to become Bob!</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `@user` is a simple `EmberObject` (in my app it's an Ember Data model).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport EmberObject from '@ember/object';\r\n\r\nexport default EmberObject.extend({\r\n  name: ''\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn ember-source v3.16.3 this works as expected and user is updated correctly. But from ember-source v3.17.0-beta.1 (and up to beta.6) this throws the following assertion from ember-simple-set-helper:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyou must pass a path to {{set}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at how the `{{set}}` works it appears that how the `positional` params are passed into the helper has changed, which I imagine is because of the glimmer-vm upgrade.\r\n\r\n#### v3.16.3\r\nHere we see the first param in the `positional` array has extracted out the `@user` target correctly.\r\n<img width=\"868\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-02-27 at 21 57 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/685034/75493257-6104a800-59b1-11ea-9152-da9a9d3eb3b7.png\">\r\n\r\n#### v3.17.0-beta.1\r\nBut here we see that the `@user` target is not extracted and is `undefined`. This causes the helper to throw an assertion on the next line.\r\n<img width=\"820\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-02-27 at 21 56 34\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/685034/75493265-64982f00-59b1-11ea-83f5-4f593c9d3ed3.png\">\r\n\r\nI have a reproduction test in https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-simple-set-helper/pull/5.

I've also confirmed the issue on the latest Beta build (3.22-beta-3).\r\n\r\nI'm aware of various other similarly-sounding reports of issues between 3.20.3 and 3.20.4 (e.g. this one on [sort](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/19101), and [this one](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/19105) which seems rather similar but is apparently fixed in 3.22-beta-3). I don't believe there's an open issue tracking this particular behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nDescribe steps to reproduce. If possible, please, share a link with a minimal reproduction.\r\n\r\n* `git clone https://github.com/samcic/reactivity-bug.git`\r\n* `cd reactivity-bug`\r\n* `yarn install`\r\n* `ember serve`\r\n* Navigate to http://localhost:4200/\r\n* Click the \"Add\" button to add some items to the collection and watch the counter increase\r\n* Click the \"Clear\" button to clear the items collection and watch the counter do nothing => BUG!\r\n* Click the \"Add\" button again to add another item, and watch the counter increase to 1 (i.e. the collection was cleared but the getter didn't react to the \"cleared\" state).\r\n\r\n### üòï Actual Behavior\r\nWhen the collection is cleared, the getter `itemsLength` doesn't fire and the template doesn't update.\r\n\r\n### ü§î Expected Behavior\r\nWhen the collection is cleared, the getter `itemsLength` should fire and the template should show the count `0`.\r\n\r\n### üåç Environment\r\n\r\n- Ember: 3.20.4 to current (issue doesn't exist in 3.20.3)\r\n- Node.js/npm: 12.14.0\r\n- OS: Windows 10\r\n- Browser: Chrome 85\r\n\r\n### ‚ûï Additional Context\r\nAdd any other context about the problem
