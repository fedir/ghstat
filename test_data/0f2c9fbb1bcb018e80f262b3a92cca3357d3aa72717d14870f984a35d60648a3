As part of generating an HTTP response from an HTTPException, HTTPException.prepare [constructs a MIMEAccept object](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/blob/309e6be0e83b5ed08f954c7dd66c5e8cf959a006/pyramid/httpexceptions.py#L253).  This means that, if a request includes a malformed Accept header, any attempt to convert an `HTTPException` (or subclass thereof) to a response will result in an unhandled exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not completely sure whether this should be fixed in pyramid or in WebOb.  WebOb's [changelog](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/webob/en/1.8-branch/whatsnew-1.8.html#backwards-incompatibilities), however, does seem to indicate that `webob.acceptparse.create_accept_header` should be used going forward, rather than constructing a `MIMEAccept` directly.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3248","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3248/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3248/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3248/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3248","id":310309379,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTAzMDkzNzk=","number":3248,"title":"Tests in \"Creating functional tests\" fail","user":{"login":"stevepiercy","id":102112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjExMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/102112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevepiercy","html_url":"https://github.com/stevepiercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevepiercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevepiercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevepiercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevepiercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevepiercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevepiercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevepiercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevepiercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevepiercy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-01T09:02:01Z","updated_at":"2018-04-01T09:26:15Z","closed_at":"2018-04-01T09:26:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"See: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-alchemy/issues/31\r\n\r\nThe functional tests here:\r\nhttps://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/testing.html#creating-functional-tests\r\n\r\nShould follow the example from the wiki tutorial:\r\nhttps://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/tutorials/wiki2/tests.html","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3247","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3247/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3247/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3247/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3247","id":306433340,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMDY0MzMzNDA=","number":3247,"title":"Request.copy() removes Pyramid-added attributes","user":{"login":"rbu","id":65913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/65913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbu","html_url":"https://github.com/rbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2018-03-19T11:58:41Z","updated_at":"2018-04-18T15:05:52Z","closed_at":"2018-04-18T15:05:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pyramid's documentation [states that ```Request.copy``` can be used to make a copy of a request](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/webob.html#methods).

documentation on `Request.route_url` for handling query string\r\nhttps://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/api/request.html#pyramid.request.Request.route_url\r\n\r\nDiscussed with @raydeo who confirmed issue in #pyramid IRC on (Tues Feb 6, 2018 around 12p Central US).\r\n\r\n`route_url` docs state, \"If no `_query` keyword argument is provided, the request query string will be returned in the URL.\"\r\n\r\nThat is not correct. If `_query` is omitted, no query is added to generated URL.\r\n\r\nNeed to check and see if it was ever correct and this functionality is broken, or if this was just never correct (or possibly intended but never implemented).\r\n\r\nBackground is that I was running through the v1.9.1 [Quick Tutorial for Pyramid, 10: Handling Web Requests and Responses](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/quick_tutorial/request_response.html)\r\n\r\nIt has you do a redirect using exception handling via `HTTPFound`, but the query string is stripped in the redirect.\r\n\r\nI wanted to learn more about how to redirect but in a more useful sense where the query and anchor are maintained, so more like what a user would expect in a true 302.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the tutorial it has the Extra Credit section and lists some links to further documentation, including [Request and Response Objects](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/webob.html#webob-chapter).\r\n\r\nI followed and then took it one step deeper to the `pyramid.request` API documentation linked from [that page](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/api/request.html#request-module).\r\n\r\nFurther recommendations are to update the documentation for `query_string` parameter of [pyramid.request](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/api/request.html#pyramid.request.Request.query_string) that tells us what kind of data structure is returned (quoted string, determined by empirically).\r\n\r\nI would also recommend updating the documentation for the `route_url` to include a recommended approach for passing the `request` query string. It seems the best way would be via something like @raydeo suggested:\r\n`request.route_url(..., _query=request.GET.items())`\r\n\r\nI had found that `_query=self.request.query_string` worked, but @raydo pointed out that this could present issues because as mentioned previously `query_string` is just a quoted string and not properly urlencoded.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3228","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3228/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3228/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3228/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3228","id":294732201,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTQ3MzIyMDE=","number":3228,"title":"Wish:
