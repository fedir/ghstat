when we hoped we were ready to release...!\n\nI was inspired by the discussion on pull request #26 and various preferences for quotations vs. apostrophes to denote literal expressions. It prompted me to run some detailed tests on orbit.model to see if the code still held up in either case, since as we know SQL has its own established standards for delimiters.\n\nThe last orbit.model example in the reference is:\n`books:find_all_by_author_or_author{ \"John Doe\", \"Jane Doe\", order = \"year_pub asc\" }`\n\nHaving created a suitable \"books\" table in a sqlite3 DB I found that this last example fails...\n\n<pre>\nlua: /usr/local/share/lua/5.1/orbit/model.lua:226: attempt to index field '?' (a nil value)\nstack traceback:\n    /usr/local/share/lua/5.1/orbit/model.lua:226: in function 'parse_condition'\n    /usr/local/share/lua/5.1/orbit/model.lua:258: in function 'build_query_by'\n</pre>\n\n\nA quick look at parse_condition and the SQL concatenation in build_query_by suggests that we only support  \"x_and_y\" clauses, not \"x_or_y\", in the method name.\n\ni.e. The following works as expected:\n`books:find_all_by_author_and_year_pub{ \"Jane Doe\", 1996 }`\n\nI've never noticed this before (perhaps because I'm not a big fan of Rails ActiveRecord and haven't much used these constructs), but suggest that before releasing we either fix the code or... (easier) just the example in the reference manual ;-)\n\nAnd if we're being strict about punctuation, the manual should read:\n`à la Rails` instead of `a la Rails` :-)\n\nP.S. I'll gladly share the test table once I've extracted it to a separate database file.\n\nCheers\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/18","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/18/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/18/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/18/events","html_url":"https://github.com/keplerproject/orbit/issues/18","id":23022318,"number":18,"title":"test_routes.lua fails with lpeg > 0.10","user":{"login":"kognix","id":5696494,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix","html_url":"https://github.com/kognix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-11-20T20:40:32Z","updated_at":"2013-12-07T19:13:32Z","closed_at":"2013-12-07T19:13:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"test_routes.lua fails at line 126 with:\n     attempt to index local 't' (a nil value)\n\nBelieve this is due to the period in the match pattern which behaves differently in later versions of lpeg.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/17","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/17/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/17/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/17/events","html_url":"https://github.com/keplerproject/orbit/issues/17","id":23000016,"number":17,"title":"Rockspecs out of sync","user":{"login":"kognix","id":5696494,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix","html_url":"https://github.com/kognix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kognix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2013-11-20T15:53:30Z","updated_at":"2013-12-07T04:04:06Z","closed_at":"2013-12-07T04:04:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The rockspec on the main Luarocks repository is 2.2.0-2 which doesn't exist here on Github.

Since `level`needs to be an integer, an error is raised (expected number instead of string).\n\nFor the sake of compatibility, I suggest the following easy fix:\n\n``` lua\n    local ok, response = xpcall(function () \n                  return handler(web, unpack(captures)) \n                end, function(msg) return debug.traceback(msg) end))\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/10","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/10/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/10/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keplerproject/orbit/issues/10/events","html_url":"https://github.com/keplerproject/orbit/issues/10","id":15117675,"number":10,"title":"Add support for float to model.lua","user":{"login":"rjpcomputing","id":51721,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/51721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjpcomputing","html_url":"https://github.com/rjpcomputing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjpcomputing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjpcomputing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjpcomputing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjpcomputing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjpcomputing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjpcomputing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjpcomputing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjpcomputing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjpcomputing/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-06-04T13:14:27Z","updated_at":"2013-06-06T14:35:24Z","closed_at":"2013-06-06T14:35:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is no support for floating point numbers in Orbit's Model.
