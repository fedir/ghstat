actually\nis. Numerous refactoring sweeps were made to homogenize comment and\ncoding styles, line lengths, code formatting, groupings and\norderings of code, etc., etc.. I'm guessing almost every line has\nbeen touched, but significantly fewer have meaningfully changed.\n\nBelow is a list of changes I've made, translated from a personal\nlist I was keeping while making edit (made s.t. I could keep track\nof what was done and what was left to do). There may be no\nmeaningful information for a review here, but I figured a reader\ncould choose to skip it if it where included. YMMV.\n\nGeneral changes:\n\n- Updated the copyright date\n- Added a descriptive comment block after the License flag\n- Use a `use_defaults` flag for determining whether or not to use the\n  default capture set, or if users provided a reduced list.\n- Removed the `get_extras` section (it only included the vnode-status\n  output. You want to see that, just run `riak-admin vnode-status`.)\n- Added a verbose level one (printing failed commands) two (printing\n  missing commands) and three (printing every command)\n- Added a `poor_mans_newline` to make it easier for me to print\n  newlines\n\nRefactoring changes:\n\n- 80 character line lengths (where possible)\n- Reordered global variable definitions and command line parsing s.t.\n  the two sections are more clearly separated\n- Applied the `local` keyword to all function-local variables (really\n  only applies do `dump`, but good practice is good)\n- English punctuation on prosaic comments -- title blocks are still\n  Title Case w/o significant punctuation.\n- Modified and homogenized title formats (s.t. they're easier to see\n  in my editor. Selfish coder is selfish.)\n- Wrap shell variables ${in_squiggly_brackets}\n\nCommand changes:\n\n- Added the below Riak commands to the `get_riakcmds` section\n  - riak-admin cluster partitions\n  - riak-admin cluster summary\n  - riak-admin handoff details\n  - riak-admin handoff summary\n  - riak-admin ringready\n  - riak-admin transfer-limit\n  - riak-repl clustername\n  - riak-repl nat-map show\n  - riak-repl realtime cascades\n- Removed the Cluster Info fetch from the `get_riakcmds` section (only\n  applies to the OSS version of this file)\n- Captured the `head` of any extant crash_dumps as part of the\n  `get_logs` section\n- Changed `lsb_release` to `lsb_release -a` (fixes basho/riak/#898)\n- Added a `dmesg -T`, s.t. we can have timestamps on at least some\n  platforms\n- Added a series of calls to extract Bucket Type configurations","tree":{"sha":"dd348248cca4730510b4b5a1c5b863d235ad37f6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/basho/riak/git/trees/dd348248cca4730510b4b5a1c5b863d235ad37f6"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/basho/riak/git/commits/200b1abc0e0f8a0edb2d76a542e0eebbda054746","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/basho/riak/commits/200b1abc0e0f8a0edb2d76a542e0eebbda054746","html_url":"https://github.com/basho/riak/commit/200b1abc0e0f8a0edb2d76a542e0eebbda054746","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/basho/riak/commits/200b1abc0e0f8a0edb2d76a542e0eebbda054746/comments","author":{"login":"TheOnlyRew","id":361216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTIxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/361216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew","html_url":"https://github.com/TheOnlyRew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"TheOnlyRew","id":361216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTIxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/361216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew","html_url":"https://github.com/TheOnlyRew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOnlyRew/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"6ca76f7abb4e896d222ffb273a08cf21f172aa7e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/basho/riak/commits/6ca76f7abb4e896d222ffb273a08cf21f172aa7e","html_url":"https://github.com/basho/riak/commit/6ca76f7abb4e896d222ffb273a08cf21f172aa7e"}]},{"sha":"6ca76f7abb4e896d222ffb273a08cf21f172aa7e","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NjEzNzIzOjZjYTc2ZjdhYmI0ZTg5NmQyMjJmZmIyNzNhMDhjZjIxZjE3MmFhN2U=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Doug
