That user says that they saw errors occur when the webserver is Litespeed with a compiled PHP LSAPI - OpenSSL.

After alot of searching, learning and tinkering I downloaded a fresh copy of Concrete5-8.3.2 and modified the following file: concrete5-8.3.2\\concrete\\config\\db.xml removing the line\r\n\r\n`<opt platform=\"MYSQL\">ENGINE=MYISAM</opt>`\r\n\r\nOnce complete I started a local XAMPP server and installed Concrete5 and everything has gone without issue, no errors or problems  to be seen. I double checked PhPMyAdmin and the table is still there; this time however it's showing as InnoDB!!\r\n\r\nFrom what I was told, MyISAM can use FULLTEXT and innoDB cannot. Which then makes sense why you'd use MyISAM for this particular table. However after reading this article: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-search.html I decided to investigate myself and see.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to know is or point out is whether this particular table is using MyISAM deliberately or in error and if it is deliberate are there any repercussions to the change that I made by removing that line?\r\n\r\nIf this doesn't pose too much of an issue, maybe it can be used as a \"fix\" for others that are in my situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16671116/37853282-de6d4cee-2edd-11e8-8849-9a5bf815e889.PNG)\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6527","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6527/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6527/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6527/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6527","id":306929642,"number":6527,"title":"Unable
