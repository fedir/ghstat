Let me know when it's done so I can add it to the changelog.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/87729","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6534","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6534/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6534/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6534/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6534","id":308552509,"number":6534,"title":"Tag block errors with PHP 7.2","user":{"login":"pvernaglia","id":1164996,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1164996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvernaglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pvernaglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvernaglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvernaglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvernaglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvernaglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvernaglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvernaglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvernaglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvernaglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvernaglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":302795213,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"009800","default":true},{"id":302795678,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/labels/priority:like%20to%20have","name":"priority:like to have","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":302794757,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-03-26T12:32:20Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T20:44:19Z","closed_at":"2018-04-04T20:44:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"PHP/7.2.1\r\n\\concrete\\blocks\\tags\\view.php\r\ncount(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable\r\n\r\nNo error with PHP7 .0","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6532","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6532/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6532/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6532/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6532","id":308181012,"number":6532,"title":"PageSearchIndex using MyISAM?","user":{"login":"hemipatu","id":16671116,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16671116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemipatu","html_url":"https://github.com/hemipatu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemipatu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemipatu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemipatu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemipatu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemipatu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemipatu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemipatu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemipatu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemipatu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":302795110,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/labels/type:discussion","name":"type:discussion","color":"207de5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2018-03-23T21:15:09Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T21:37:00Z","closed_at":"2018-03-28T21:37:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am unsure about what I am about to say, so please forgive me if I am wrong.\r\n\r\nRecently I discovered that the table `PageSearchIndex` used MyISAM and because of this, I was unable to use a second generation cloud SQL server that Google provides. After alot of searching, learning and tinkering I downloaded a fresh copy of Concrete5-8.3.2 and modified the following file: concrete5-8.3.2\\concrete\\config\\db.xml removing the line\r\n\r\n`<opt platform=\"MYSQL\">ENGINE=MYISAM</opt>`\r\n\r\nOnce complete I started a local XAMPP server and installed Concrete5 and everything has gone without issue, no errors or problems  to be seen. I double checked PhPMyAdmin and the table is still there; this time however it's showing as InnoDB!!\r\n\r\nFrom what I was told, MyISAM can use FULLTEXT and innoDB cannot. Which then makes sense why you'd use MyISAM for this particular table. However after reading this article: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-search.html I decided to investigate myself and see.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to know is or point out is whether this particular table is using MyISAM deliberately or in error and if it is deliberate are there any repercussions to the change that I made by removing that line?\r\n\r\nIf this doesn't pose too much of an issue, maybe it can be used as a \"fix\" for others that are in my situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16671116/37853282-de6d4cee-2edd-11e8-8849-9a5bf815e889.PNG)\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6527","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6527/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6527/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6527/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6527","id":306929642,"number":6527,"title":"Unable

pages have a few issues on multilingual sites, some seem like bugs, others might fall under the purview of enhancements/nice to haves, but I'll post them all here anyway since they all kinda fall under the same umbrella.\r\n\r\nI've set this up on the the development branch but these have been present since at least 8.2.1.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nNote: I've included my local urls, but change those where appropriate.\r\n\r\n1) Install concrete5, I've set it up with the empty theme but this doesn't matter.\r\n2) Navigate to http://localhost:8888/index.php/dashboard/system/multilingual/setup\r\n3) Add locale\r\nDetails: I added *French*, template *Full*, page name *Home*, slug *fr*\r\n3a) I've also enabled toolbar titles for a bit more clarity\r\n\r\n4) Add `<?php echo \\Concrete\\Core\\Localization\\Localization::activeLocale(); ?>` to `concrete/themes/elemental/page_not_found.php`\r\n\r\n4) Navigate to http://localhost:8888/index.php/404\r\nThis results in a standard 404 page, with en_US shown on the page as the locale, so this expected behaviour\r\n\r\n5) Now try it with the french locale slug http://localhost:8888/index.php/fr/404\r\nThis is where things get confusing. This still loads the standard 404 page, but the localization is lost, we are still seeing en_US as the locale, even though we're on the french localization of the site\r\n\r\n     Additionally, concrete5 seems to not know what language to display here, as we're seeing two related pages language buttons in the toolbar\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-03-06 at 13 58 55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30590452/37036112-95f1651c-2146-11e8-878b-18508b4ee168.png)\r\n\r\n6) Now, go back to http://localhost:8888/index.php/dashboard/system/multilingual/setup and change the default locale to French\r\n\r\n7) Go back to http://localhost:8888/index.php/fr/404\r\n\r\n    I would expect the locale to now show as fr_FR, but it still shows as en_US\r\n\r\nThis all makes localization of 404 pages very difficult.\r\n\r\n**Halfway solution:**\r\n\r\nThis isn't really a solution, but it worked for my use case. Hopefully it at least points to a resolution.\r\n\r\nhttp://localhost:8888/index.php/dashboard/system/multilingual/setup change the default locale back to english\r\n\r\nThe issues are all, as far as I can tell, in: https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/blob/develop/concrete/src/Http/ResponseFactory.php\r\n\r\nLine 92, I've replaced \r\n\r\n`$item = '/page_not_found';`\r\n\r\nwith \r\n\r\n```\r\n$home = \\Page::getByID(\\Page::getCurrentPage()->getSiteHomePageID());\r\n$slug = $home->getCollectionHandle();\r\n$item = '/' . $slug . '/page_not_found';\r\n```\r\n\r\nand line 237, I've replaced\r\n\r\n`if ($collection->getCollectionPath() != '/page_not_found') {`\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n`if (strpos($collection->getCollectionPath(), '/page_not_found') == false) {`\r\n\r\nI also had to copy the `Page Not Found` system page across to all locales using the sitemap in the dashboard.\r\n\r\nNow visit http://localhost:8888/index.php/fr/404\r\n\r\nThis leads to something slightly more in line with expected behaviour. This doesn't fix the duplicate related pages buttons, but they both appear as the correct language now, and the localization locale appears correct now too.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the locale isn't actually ever set on system pages, regardless of the settings. System pages will just always be whatever language the site was installed with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6495","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6495/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6495/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6495/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6495","id":302263820,"number":6495,"title":"Error on invalid token for \"import_remote\"","user":{"login":"guyasyou","id":1362419,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1362419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyasyou","html_url":"https://github.com/guyasyou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyasyou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyasyou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyasyou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyasyou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyasyou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyasyou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyasyou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyasyou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyasyou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-03-05T11:25:40Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T20:52:34Z","closed_at":"2018-03-05T20:52:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"$$error\r\nhttps://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/blob/7af7f7012df2d72d2ea044bb672a99a9f5477e55/concrete/tools/files/importers/remote.php#L71","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6491","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6491/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6491/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6491/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6491","id":302187059,"number":6491,"title":"Deleting a File Leaves it Selected in Form","user":{"login":"gondwanasoft","id":29833658,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/29833658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gondwanasoft","html_url":"https://github.com/gondwanasoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gondwanasoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gondwanasoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gondwanasoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gondwanasoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gondwanasoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gondwanasoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gondwanasoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gondwanasoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gondwanasoft/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":302795213,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"009800","default":true},{"id":302794757,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-03-05T06:37:08Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T21:01:59Z","closed_at":"2018-04-11T20:50:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Add Form block (not ‘legacy’)\r\n\r\nSelect ‘New Form’ (not ‘Express’)\r\n\r\nAdd question with Answer Type of Image/File, and Input Format of ‘File Manager Selector’.\r\n\r\nSave and publish.\r\n\r\nUse the form to select a file.

This means I know which codes are to be translated, and which ones that are to remain as it is.

The way this adapter fetches the queue messages for a specified queue is flawed which causes \r\n\r\nThis impacts directly to the data integrity regarding queueable jobs as the queued messages may be mixed up between the different queues.\r\n\r\nAn example of the impact is our integration implemented on top of concrete5's queueable jobs which synchronizes the user database and invoicing information to an external system. There are two separate jobs:\r\n\r\n- A job that synchronizes user records to the external database\r\n- A job that synchronizes invoicing information to the external database\r\n\r\nBoth jobs are set to run so that the used \"queue messages\" are the record IDs for the records being synchronized (i.e. users or invoices). These are set to run 30 minutes from each other in the given order.\r\n\r\nIn case the first job does not finish before the second starts AND a `handle` value has been entered for the queue message, the second job may be processing the queue messages entered by the first process.\r\n\r\nThis caused certain invoices to be synchronized which should not have been synchronized.\r\n\r\n## Technical details\r\n\r\nThis is related to the database query in the `Concrete\\Core\\Foundation\\Queue\\DatabaseQueueAdapter` class that fetches the queue messages:\r\nhttps://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/blob/4b7678958eaec14b234b154efdfb3d8a65552669/concrete/src/Foundation/Queue/DatabaseQueueAdapter.php#L194\r\n\r\nThe `OR` clause is written without parentheses which causes this issue.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6454","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6454/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6454/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6454/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6454","id":298931468,"number":6454,"title":" can't delete report form results","user":{"login":"skau61","id":24296541,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/24296541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61","html_url":"https://github.com/skau61","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-02-21T11:19:34Z","updated_at":"2018-03-01T01:11:25Z","closed_at":"2018-03-01T01:11:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi\r\n- creating a normal standard module I get results in dashboard under report - form results\r\n- if I delete the module from a page, I still can see results in dashboard under report - form results\r\n- but in dashboard, under report - form results, I can not delete the specific module results\r\n\r\nAt the end, if I did played creating and deleting a lot of modules, I'm plenty of entries in dashbord and can not delete them\r\n\r\nIt is not critical, but could this be fixed adding an option in dashboard to delete form results ?
