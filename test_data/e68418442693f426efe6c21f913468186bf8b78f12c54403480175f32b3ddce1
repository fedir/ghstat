I am a web developer by profession and an experienced Filipino translator - these are on top of being an experienced web developer with more than 6 years of experience and specialized in the following scripting languages and technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, JQUERY, PHP, WORDPRESS and CONCRETE5). This means I know which codes are to be translated, and which ones that are to remain as it is. I am a strong advocate of thought-by-thought instead of word-by-word style of doing the translations, and I am carefully strict in grammars and spellings and proper word conjugations of my languages, Filipino and Tagalog.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you soon and work with you in the translations. You can count on me that I will do my job with utmost dedication.

The way this adapter fetches the queue messages for a specified queue is flawed which causes \r\n\r\nThis impacts directly to the data integrity regarding queueable jobs as the queued messages may be mixed up between the different queues.\r\n\r\nAn example of the impact is our integration implemented on top of concrete5's queueable jobs which synchronizes the user database and invoicing information to an external system. There are two separate jobs:\r\n\r\n- A job that synchronizes user records to the external database\r\n- A job that synchronizes invoicing information to the external database\r\n\r\nBoth jobs are set to run so that the used \"queue messages\" are the record IDs for the records being synchronized (i.e. users or invoices). These are set to run 30 minutes from each other in the given order.\r\n\r\nIn case the first job does not finish before the second starts AND a `handle` value has been entered for the queue message, the second job may be processing the queue messages entered by the first process.\r\n\r\nThis caused certain invoices to be synchronized which should not have been synchronized.\r\n\r\n## Technical details\r\n\r\nThis is related to the database query in the `Concrete\\Core\\Foundation\\Queue\\DatabaseQueueAdapter` class that fetches the queue messages:\r\nhttps://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/blob/4b7678958eaec14b234b154efdfb3d8a65552669/concrete/src/Foundation/Queue/DatabaseQueueAdapter.php#L194\r\n\r\nThe `OR` clause is written without parentheses which causes this issue.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6454","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6454/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6454/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6454/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6454","id":298931468,"number":6454,"title":" can't delete report form results","user":{"login":"skau61","id":24296541,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/24296541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61","html_url":"https://github.com/skau61","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skau61/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-02-21T11:19:34Z","updated_at":"2018-03-01T01:11:25Z","closed_at":"2018-03-01T01:11:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi\r\n- creating a normal standard module I get results in dashboard under report - form results\r\n- if I delete the module from a page, I still can see results in dashboard under report - form results\r\n- but in dashboard, under report - form results, I can not delete the specific module results\r\n\r\nAt the end, if I did played creating and deleting a lot of modules, I'm plenty of entries in dashbord and can not delete them\r\n\r\nIt is not critical, but could this be fixed adding an option in dashboard to delete form results ?

SiteTrees are described in the `SiteTrees` + `SiteTreeTrees` database tables (persisting the `SiteTree` entity) with a 1:1 relation with the `SiteLocales` database table\r\n- *Pages*, that are associated to Site Trees (via the `Pages`.`siteTreeID` database column).

There is no way to add the actual value for the attribute. The dashboard calendar UI does not allow you to select displayed attributes for the calendars and the attribute is not visible in the calendar event edit page.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\nThe attribute should be either selectable to be displayed in the calendar event details or it should be always displayed.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6390","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6390/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6390/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6390/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6390","id":294406021,"number":6390,"title":"Calendar does not use 24 hours format like rest of the Dashboard","user":{"login":"Hypocrite","id":1395541,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1395541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hypocrite","html_url":"https://github.com/Hypocrite","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hypocrite/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hypocrite/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hypocrite/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hypocrite/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hypocrite/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hypocrite/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hypocrite/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hypocrite/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hypocrite/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-02-05T14:11:35Z","updated_at":"2018-02-14T15:13:58Z","closed_at":"2018-02-14T15:13:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Using the latest version 8.3.2.

If you have similar named groups 'Test Group', 'Test Group 2' and you search for users in 'Test Group' - It will also show users from 'Test Group 2'\r\n\r\n3. Searching for multiple groups, currently if you search with multiple groups concrete5 will treat them as 'in any one of the groups' and not in all of these groups.\r\n\r\n4. Another Issue is the Not in group, It shows users who are in the group you are trying to exclude if they belong to another group. This is also the problem with the GroupTests, example below:\r\nIn the group tests we add 3 people to Group A then take 1 person from Group B and add them into Group A. That means there are 3 people who are not in group B, as one is of group A is also in group B. Currently both the test and the core treats it as 4 people. \r\nThe code for the test is here: \r\n```\r\n $users = array(\r\n            array('zxcvz1231', 'andrew@concrete5.org'),\r\n            array('asdfzsdf', 'testuser1@concrete5.org'),\r\n            array('sdfbzxc', 'testuser2@concrete5.org'),\r\n            array('zksjdf7', 'testuser3@concrete5.org'),\r\n            array('kdufiz', 'testuser4@concrete5.org'),\r\n            array('swrefxzd', 'testuser5@concrete5.org'),\r\n            array('abbabdf', 'testuser6@concrete5.org'),\r\n            array('ffdsazs', 'testuser7@concrete5.org'),\r\n            array('zxsdfer', 'testuser8@concrete5.org'),\r\n        );\r\n        $i = 0;\r\n        foreach ($users as $user) {\r\n            $ui = $this->createUser($user[0], $user[1]);\r\n            $user = $ui->getUserObject();\r\n            if (in_array($i, [0,2,3])) {\r\n                $user->enterGroup($groupA);\r\n            } else {\r\n                $user->enterGroup($groupB);\r\n            }\r\n            $i++;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        $user = \\UserInfo::getByName('zxsdfer');\r\n        $user = $user->getUserObject();\r\n        $user->enterGroup($groupA);\r\n\r\n\r\n$list3 = new UserList();\r\n        $list3->filterByGroup($groupB, false);\r\n        $results = $list3->getResults();\r\n        $this->assertEquals(4, count($results));\r\n```","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6368","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6368/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6368/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6368/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6368","id":293614387,"number":6368,"title":"Sitemap empty in Firefox","user":{"login":"mlocati","id":928116,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/928116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati","html_url":"https://github.com/mlocati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-02-01T17:18:54Z","updated_at":"2018-02-02T07:24:48Z","closed_at":"2018-02-02T07:24:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"On Chrome everything works fine:\r\n\r\n![immagine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/928116/35692609-1b330918-077c-11e8-9f81-274d13ee1beb.png)\r\n\r\nBut on Firefox (58.0.1) the sitemap is empty:\r\n\r\n![immagine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/928116/35692642-2f25dcd4-077c-11e8-9f5e-d384f7745c53.png)\r\n\r\n(the same occurs in the `/dashboard/sitemap/full` dashboard page).","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6359","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6359/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6359/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6359/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/6359","id":293188215,"number":6359,"titl

However, when you have multiple languages, the \"keywords\" search does not match the \"select\" attributes in the given language because it only searches against the database's search index table where the values are stored in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create a new site with two languages: English and Finnish\r\n- Add a new express entity, let's call it \"Person\"\r\n- Add two fields for it:\r\n  * Name: text\r\n  * Role: select with values \"Management\", \"Operations\", \"Customer Service\"\r\n- Add few entries to the \"Person\" database (your choice)\r\n- Go to Dashboard => System and Settings => Multilingual => Translate Site Interface\r\n- Click \"Reload Strings\"\r\n- Edit the Finnish translation and set the select value translations as follows: \"Johto\", \"Operaatiot\", \"Asiakaspalvelu\".\r\n- Click \"Save to file\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, go to the site and add a new page under the Finnish language. In this page, add the Express list block and enable filtering by keyword.\r\n\r\nNow, if you try to search by the \"johto\" keyword for example, you get no results because it's only searching against the Finnish\r\n\r\n## Suggested fix\r\n\r\nI have two solution proposals for this that are the following:\r\n\r\n**Solution 1 - Multilingual Select Attribute**\r\n\r\nMake a change to the \"select\" attribute and add a search index column for each active language. When the attribute is being indexed, populate the search index with the translation string.\r\n\r\n**Solution 2 - Language Specific Search Indexes**\r\n\r\nOne way to fix this would be to create and populate the search index table for each language. This would mean that e.g. in this case there would be the following search index tables:\r\n\r\n- `PersonExpressSearchIndexAttributes` (default language)\r\n- `PersonExpressSearchIndexAttributes_fi_FI`\r\n\r\nEvery time the languages are added/changed or the default is changed, these tables would need to be updated and reindexed.","score":1.0}]}
