I am a web developer by profession and an experienced Filipino translator - these are on top of being an experienced web developer with more than 6 years of experience and specialized in the following scripting languages and technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, JQUERY, PHP, WORDPRESS and CONCRETE5). This means I know which codes are to be translated, and which ones that are to remain as it is. I am a strong advocate of thought-by-thought instead of word-by-word style of doing the translations, and I am carefully strict in grammars and spellings and proper word conjugations of my languages, Filipino and Tagalog.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you soon and work with you in the translations. You can count on me that I will do my job with utmost dedication.
