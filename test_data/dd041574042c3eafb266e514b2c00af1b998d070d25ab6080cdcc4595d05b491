in old style\r\n- [x] (https://github.com/zikula/core/commit/5f327d30aa9d50fbe1287c5ab27780e482fbbdb8) Theme: set default theme to `Bootstrap` (Andreas08 and SeaBreeze are removed, custom ones could break).\r\n- [x] (https://github.com/zikula/core/commit/85a69ad5544b6ec23d770e35cb17062f5a289b0b) Parameter changes:\r\n    - The parameters `temp_dir`, `system.chmod_dir`, `url_secret` and `umask` have been removed without any replacement.\r\n    - Some other parameter have been removed in favour of environment variables\r\n      - `env` became `APP_ENV`.\r\n      - `debug` became `APP_DEBUG`.\r\n      - `secret` became `APP_SECRET`.\r\n      - `database_*` became `DATABASE_URL`.\r\n      - mailer settings now in `MAILER_DSN` (convert from swift mailer)\r\n    - use `Zikula\\Bundle\\CoreBundle\\Helper\\LocalDotEnvHelper`\r\n- [x] (https://github.com/zikula/core/commit/b8fb718baef886d3818320e304d0700d5658c72e)  Fix docs\r\n  - install (e.g. web root _must_ point to `public/` according to [Symfony docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/web_server_configuration.html))\r\n  - upgrade (e.g. web root _must_ point to `public/` now according to [Symfony docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/web_server_configuration.html); mention charset recoding process for MySQL)\r\n    - add note to double check fontawesome icons in menu module options\r\n- [x] (https://github.com/zikula/core/commit/cdf5a990760d12ca588f01a6f8ee3385a48117be) Remove all permission schemes for `ZikulaThemeModule::ThemeChange` component.\r\n- [x] (https://github.com/zikula/core/commit/b8fb718baef886d3818320e304d0700d5658c72e) Note from DoctrineBundle v2: _When no charset parameter is defined, it now defaults to `utf8mb4` on the MySQL platform and to `utf8` on all other platforms._ -> So ideally nothing should be defined in `config/packages/doctrine.yaml` and `.env.local` (refs #3784, #4246).","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zikula/core/issues/4280","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zikula/core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zikula/core/issues/4280/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zikula/core/issues/4280/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zikula/core/issues/4280/events","html_url":"https://github.com/zikula/core/issues/4280","id":607628326,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MDc2MjgzMjY=","number":4280,"title":"sync

For the twig-inspector there is no such fallback yet.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if:\r\n\r\n* either (preferably) twig-inspector could do the same as Symfony does so even without a configured editor things work (prevent a 404 page)\r\n* or (alternatively) a message could be shown (for example [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oroinc/twig-inspector/master/Bundle/Resources/doc/images/toolbar-extension-icon.png)) so the user knows that he needs to configure something in `/config/packages/dev/framework.yaml`. I have added documentation, but this is not directly visible and it would avoid a frustrating experience if twig-inspector could directly inform the user that something is missing.\r\n* a third solution (which could be combined with a message) could be that if no editor is configured file paths are just shown but not linked.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zikula-modules/Pages/issues/56","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zikula-modules/Pages","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zikula-modules/Pages/issues/56/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zikula-modules/Pages/issues/56/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zikula-modules/Pages/issues/56/events","html_url":"https://github.com/zikula-modules/Pages/issues/56","id":150673607,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNTA2NzM2MDc=","number":56,"title":"pages can not be installed for Zikula 1.4.2","user":{"login":"rallek","id":935250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTI1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/935250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rallek","html_url":"https://github.com/rallek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rallek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rallek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rallek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rallek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rallek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rallek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rallek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rallek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rallek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":23,"created_at":"2016-04-24T15:35:56Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T06:39:12Z","closed_at":"2020-05-07T06:39:12Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I tried `master` and `v3.01` as well.
