So it seems like my priors are forcing my model into a solution that doesn't fit well with my isotope data. I tried reducing my number of sources from six to five and then down to four by grouping them together but that didn't help. When I use an \"uninformative\" prior then my models do reach convergence but the results do not seem very accurate (fungi comes out as the main food source) so I think it would be important to include priors.

If the files fit into /tmp they do not seem to go down the same NoCache code path and the upload works fine.  Likewise if I specify a cache directory with enough space it does not trigger the issue.   Using latest github commit, compiled on same system indicated in information above.    The 'ensure_diskfree' flag can be used to simulate the issue as well - if a file would go over the diskfree requirement then the same error is encountered.  \r\n\r\nResult of copy command: \r\n```\r\ncp 1GB_file /fuse/bucket/ \r\ncp: error writing ‘/fuse/bucket/1GB_file’: Input/output error\r\ncp: failed to extend ‘/fuse/bucket/1GB_file’: Input/output error\r\ncp: failed to close ‘/fuse/bucket/1GB_file’: Operation not permitted\r\n```\r\nAnother issue referring specifically to 10GB files also seems likely to be the same, I would not be surprised if the reason a 10GB file fails is because that is the limit of /tmp on that particular system:  https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse/issues/1033\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/usnistgov/REFPROP-cmake/issues/38","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/usnistgov/REFPROP-cmake","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/usnistgov/REFPROP-cmake/issues/38/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/usnistgov/REFPROP-cmake/issues/38/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/usnistgov/REFPROP-cmake/issues/38/events","html_url":"https://github.com/usnistgov/REFPROP-cmake/issues/38","id":591193289,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1OTExOTMyODk=","number":38,"title":"CoolProp / REFPROP fails when invoked from multiple python processes in parallel","user":{"login":"mar1u50","id":17710919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzEwOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17710919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mar1u50","html_url":"https://github.com/mar1u50","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mar1u50/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mar1u50/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mar1u50/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mar1u50/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mar1u50/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mar1u50/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mar1u50/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mar1u50/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mar1u50/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2020-03-31T15:15:22Z","updated_at":"2020-08-25T13:44:27Z","closed_at":"2020-08-25T13:44:27Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I have a script that runs multiple python scrips using CoolProp/RefProp in parallel.\r\nSometime I have 10 processes running in parallel correctly but sometime some of the processes give:\r\n```\r\nGood news: It is possible to use REFPROP on your system!

To do that, I was thinking in calculate ETo using different methods outside apsim and provide these data as input in the met file or change the eo calculation into the model (i), create a tree factorial specifing which water module should be used, e.g. SoilWat or SWIM3 (ii) and calculate the daily nitrogen concentration of different organs outside apsim (e.g. using a more simple model like SIMPLACE) and provide these data as an input for apsim (i.e. reemplacing the N dynamic proccess in APSIM NG).

Still a minor problem in N-terminal LEU, the non-bonded interactions are off by -0.0137 kJ/mol.  There is another issue in C-terminal ASN, where the dihedral energies still differ by -0.0584 kJ/mol.  But, all of the other interactions match to within 0.01 kJ/mol.

There is a planar group on the side-chain that involves impropers.  It might be good to try twisting some structures to exaggerate these and other impropers, because the equilibrium state of all these things is going to be near zero, and saying \"zero\" does not necessarily mean that we understand the details of the potential energy term as they should be.\r\n> \r\n> I will make a \"challenge\" data set with more interesting, strained conformations to see if our new scripts can get those.

They advised me to try a pure oxygen setup in the SM, so I followed their advice and hooked up some manifolds and stuff. Here's some diagrams showing where the manifolds were. The loop ones were just inside the walls where the pipe-cooling converter touches it normally. So I added 2 scrubbers to the chamber, extended the chamber pipes out a bit to make room for a manifold, and put that manifold inside the wall.\r\n\r\n![Chamber](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38158801/90371930-01ab6900-e0b3-11ea-8f14-0ea89d6ea6f6.png)\r\n\r\n![Loop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38158801/90371935-02dc9600-e0b3-11ea-8465-86593c1263dd.png)\r\n\r\nAt some point during these events, I randomly acquired the \"bluespace prophet\" brain trauma, or whatever it's called. The one that makes portals appear that you can move though.\r\n\r\nAll the scrubbers were set to maximum scrub, all the vents were set to internal pressure 0 with external disabled.\r\n\r\nI went to fetch a can of nitrogen to start the engine up, and when I got back I noticed the engine was a big fire, so I checked the monitor and it was like 90% oxygen in there. Some air HAD been brought in through the airlock as I went in to install scrubbers, but nothing else happened. No emitters or anything.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was me trying to fix it, I wasn't watching the monitor program constantly, but when I did sometimes it seemed like there were HUGE influxes of oxygen from absolutely nowhere. I checked the piping and the atmos-engine pipe wasn't on at any point, all the manifolds I put in were BEFORE the gas filters, so even if they were letting in oxygen it should have been ejected out before going back in to the engine.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can think is that maybe the bluespace prophet portals can transport gases, and that one of them ended up with one end inside the compressed oxygen container, and the other end inside the chamber.\r\n\r\nThis was completely bewildering, and the person who suggested I try, the traitor, says they have no idea why it was happening.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aristocratos/bashtop/issues/166","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aristocratos/bashtop","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aristocratos/bashtop/issues/166/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aristocratos/bashtop/issues/166/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aristocratos/bashtop/issues/166/events","html_url":"https://github.com/aristocratos/bashtop/issues/166","id":654486654,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NTQ0ODY2NTQ=","number":166,"title":"[BUG] Crashes on OSX due to cpu[temp_high] syntax error: invalid arithmetic operato","user":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1940856997,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTQwODU2OTk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aristocratos/bashtop/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something isn't working"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aristocratos","id":59659483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NjU5NDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/59659483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos","html_url":"https://github.com/aristocratos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aristocratos","id":59659483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NjU5NDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/59659483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos","html_url":"https://github.com/aristocratos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aristocratos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2020-07-10T03:41:38Z","updated_at":"2020-07-14T17:45:11Z","closed_at":"2020-07-10T22:36:25Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nCrashes on OSX after a few minutes.
