WinUI 3.0\r\n\r\nAt the Microsoft Build conference in May 2019 we shared our plans for WinUI 3.0, which will greatly expand the scope of WinUI to include the full native Windows UI platform. This means that the full Xaml framework would be developed on GitHub and ship out of band as [NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/what-is-nuget) packages.\r\n\r\nThe WinUI roadmap is now up to date with the latest plans for WinUI 3.0:  \r\n**https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md**\r\n\r\nYou can also watch the Build 2019 conference session *[State of the Union: The Windows Presentation Platform](https://mybuild.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/77008)* for more details.\r\n\r\nWe'd love to hear what you think, and have some specific questions below.\r\n\r\n## How will this affect building Windows apps and components?\r\n\r\nWinUI 3.0 will provide many benefits compared to the UWP Xaml framework, WPF, WinForms and MFC.\r\n\r\nSo, we want to make sure it's easy for everyone to use WinUI 3.0 in new and existing apps. There are a few ways we can approach this, and we'd love to hear your feedback on what areas we should focus on.\r\n\r\nOur current thinking is:\r\n\r\n### Creating a new app\r\n\r\nWe plan to create new Visual Studio 2019 project templates for common languages (e.g. C# using .NET Core, standard C++17 using [C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/)) and app model + packaging (UWP + AppX, Win32 + [MSIX](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/)).\r\n\r\n> **What templates would interest you most?**\r\n\r\nThe developer experience would be similar to current UWP apps.\r\n\r\n### Adding WinUI 3.0 to existing Win32 apps\r\n\r\nWinUI 3.0 will include [Xaml Islands](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/xaml-host-controls), which let you use WinUI Xaml in your existing WPF, Windows Forms, and C++ Win32 applications.\r\n\r\nThe current version of Xaml Islands is only supported on Windows 10 May 2019 Update (1903), but the WinUI version should be backward-compatible to Creators Update (15063).\r\n\r\n> **Were you aware of Xaml Islands for modernizing desktop apps?  \r\nDoes this expanded backward-compatibility on Windows 10 make Xaml Islands more useful to you?**\r\n\r\n### Updating your existing UWP Xaml app to WinUI 3.0\r\n\r\nYou'll have to update your app's target version to WinUI 3.0 to take advantage of it, similar to retargeting to a newer UWP SDK today.\r\n\r\nWe want to maximize compatibility between UWP Xaml and WinUI 3.0, but there will be some things to be aware of when updating.\r\n\r\n1\\. **Namespace update**\r\n\r\nThe root namespace for Xaml, composition, and input APIs in WinUI will be different than the Windows UWP SDK root namespace:\r\n\r\n| Old namespace | New namespace (tentative) |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| `Windows.UI.Xaml` | `Microsoft.UI.Xaml` |\r\n| `Windows.UI.Composition` | `Microsoft.UI.Composition` |\r\n| `Windows.UI.Input` | `Microsoft.UI.Input` |\r\n\r\nWe're exploring options for helping you automatically update namespaces when retargeting your UWP app to WinUI 3, at least for .NET apps.\r\n\r\n> **Would it help if Visual Studio or another tool automatically updated namespaces for you?**\r\n\r\n2\\. **Mixing UWP and WinUI Xaml components**\r\n\r\nThe fastest path to releasing WinUI 3.0 would be to not support mixing:\r\n\r\n* UWP [Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement) and  [Windows.UI.Composition.Visual](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/composition/composition-visual-tree) elements\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n* WinUI 3.0 `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.UIElement` and `Microsoft.UI.Composition.Visual` elements\r\n\r\nin the same app.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of our biggest concerns is the compatibility issues and work that could create for existing UWP apps and component libraries, particularly if you're authoring or consuming UWP Xaml control libraries.  \r\nFor example, existing versions of the [Windows Community Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit) wouldn't be usable in WinUI 3.0 apps, so both the Toolkit and any apps using it would need to update before using WinUI 3.0.\r\n\r\nWe hope that all UWP Xaml control libraries can be updated to WinUI 3.0, but we know that even in the best case it would take time for everyone to update.\r\n\r\n> **How important to you is full compatibility between existing UWP Xaml components and WinUI 3.0 apps?**  \r\n\r\n> **Do you create or use UWP Xaml control libraries or WinRT components that you couldn't easily recompile and update alongside app code?**\r\n\r\n> **What would be your preferred solution for using UWP Xaml components with WinUI 3?**\r\n\r\n## General questions\r\n\r\n1. What do you think about the overall 3.0 plan outlined above and in the [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md)? Would it enable you to use WinUI for your new and existing Windows apps?\r\n\r\n2. What kind of apps would you be most excited to use WinUI 3.0 for? Creating a new Win32 app and packaging it with [MSIX](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/)? Adding new views to a WPF app? Modernizing a C++ MFC app with Fluent UI?

TLDR\r\n\r\nWith a large ear project with multiple war/jars, it is desirable to use skinnywar to keep the size down.\r\nThis does not work with Vaadin14\r\n\r\n### Our existing Vaadin8 app\r\n\r\nIn our Vaadin8 based application we have 10 wars, 5 jars + one \"widgetset\" war.\r\nThose wars that use vaadin depend on the \"widgetset\" war, and everything works fine.\r\n\r\nWe have also turned on \"skinnywar\" in the ear build, to place all shared jars in ear\\lib and keep the overall size down.\r\nWith skinnywar on, or ear is 100M.\r\nWithout skinnywar, our ear is 180M. \r\nSo skinnywar gives a significant saving that we'd like to keep when moving to Vaadin14.\r\n\r\n### Trying the same in Vaadin14\r\n\r\nSo far in my Vaadin14 experiments it seems it is not possible to use skinnywar.\r\nWith Skinnywar on, and 2 war/jars depending on Vaadin, all vaadin jars end up in ear\\lib, and they are unable to use the classloader to\r\n1) access the frontend stuff in the war\r\n2) Scan for @Route\r\n\r\nAs soon as I remove skinnywar, my tester ear project works.\r\n\r\nNote: This issue is perhaps not present in all application servers. It depends how their classloader is implemented. We use wildfly 18, and there, if jar A depends on jar B, A's classloader can see B's classes, but B's classloader can't see A's.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it also doesn't seem possible in Vaadin14 to create a shared \"widgetset\". So far it seems all Vaadin-based wars must build their own copy of the client-side .\r\n\r\nThis means that for each Vaadin-based war I'll get an overhead of about:\r\n* 3MB of frontend stuff\r\n* 14MB of jars\r\n\r\n( Based on my trivial starter project and Vaadin 14.2.0.alpha7 )\r\n\r\nIf I convert all 10 wars in my ear to vaadin, that means an overhead of 170M!\r\nAdding in the 80MB of shared classes from the rest of our app, it means our 100MB Vaadi8 app becomes a 350MB Vaadin14 app!\r\n\r\n### Possible solution?\r\n\r\nWith my simplistic understanding of Vaadin's internal workings, this could pehaps be solved if each war had an \"entrypoint\" class (MyServlet extends VaadinServlet perhaps?) and Vaadin used its classloader. This would then see everything in the war, even if the rest of vaadin's classes were in ear\\lib.\r\n\r\nWith something like this, we would get rid of 14MB of the per-war overhead.\r\nWe would still have the 3MB of frontend stuff per war, but size-wise this would be a huge improvement.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scalikejdbc/csvquery/issues/13","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scalikejdbc/csvquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scalikejdbc/csvquery/issues/13/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scalikejdbc/csvquery/issues/13/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scalikejdbc/csvquery/issues/13/events","html_url":"https://github.com/scalikejdbc/csvquery/issues/13","id":456606588,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTY2MDY1ODg=","number":13,"title":"publish

case).\r\n\r\nWe're using the CircleCI image for XCode 10.3.0: https://circle-macos-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/image-manifest/build-903/index.html\r\n\r\nWhy: Because our build scripts need tools not included in macOS, and Homebrew is the same tool we use in our local environments.\r\n\r\n# What happened (include command output)\r\n\r\nHomebrew takes 2-3 minutes to complete a `brew

Given a formula whose latest _released_ version is 3.0.0 (to which the formula will be bumped), with the formula on github (origin) at 2.0.0, and with the current tap still pointing to 1.0.0.\r\n\r\n(That is, the local tap repo is _not_ up to date; such that `brew bump-formula-pr` will do an update automatically.)\r\n\r\n2. When running: `HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER=true brew bump-formula-pr --url=https://github.com/foo/bar/archive/v3.0.0.tar.gz --sha256={256} bar`\r\n\r\n3. Then the first invocation will run brew-update to update the tap, and then fail when attempting to bump the formula with: `Error: inreplace failed`.\r\n\r\n4. Running the same bump-formula-pr command again immediately after will then succeed. (Now that the tap has been updated and is \"fresh\" at the start of the command.)\r\n\r\nThe same issue has occurred twice in a row for me in normal use. (During the last two bumps of node-build.) And I was able to reproduce a third time by manually checking out a commit from before the last time node-build.rb was modified. (ergo, the formula itself was not in latest state w.r.t. origin)\r\n\r\nAlso reproduced with libyaml.

Pettisani](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=diepet)** opened **[SPR-16714](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16714?redirect=false)** and commented\n\nWe had a performance issue after upgraded from Spring **3.2.2** to **3.2.16**.\n\nOur application is packaged in an EAR file having several \"skinny\" WARs, so the content inside the EAR is:\n\n```\n.\n|-- lib\n|   -- spring-core-3.2.16.jar\n|   -- spring-beans-3.2.16.jar\n|   -- company-platform.jar\n|   -- etc. etc.\n|-- META-INF\n|   -- application.xml\n|-- app1.war\n|   -- WEB-INF\n|      -- web.xml\n|      -- webapp-beans.xml\n|-- app2.war\n|   -- WEB-INF\n|      -- web.xml\n|      -- webapp-beans.xml\n| -- more wars.....\n.\n```\n\nIn each **web.xml** file we have this configuration:\n\n```xml\n...\n<context-param>\n\t<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>\n\t<param-value>WEB-INF/webapp-beans.xml</param-value>\n</context-param>\n<context-param>\n\t<param-name>parentContextKey</param-name>\n\t<param-value>ear.context</param-value>\n</context-param>\n<listener>\n\t<listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>\n</listener>\n...\n```\n\nThe parent context has several hundred of beans.\n\nWe developed an internal platform for our applications that often calls the following **BeanFactory** method:\n\n```java\norg.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory.getBean(Class)\n```\n\nIn turn, The above **getBean(Class)** method calls the following **DefaultListableBeanFactory** method:\n\n```java\norg.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory.getBeanNamesForType(Class<?>, boolean, boolean)\n```\n\nAfter upgraded to Spring **3.2.16** the call to the above **getBeanNamesForType()** method was very slow and CPU consuming. The root cause is the following class loader check:\n\n```java\nif (ClassUtils.isCacheSafe(type, getBeanClassLoader())) {\n\tcache.put(type, resolvedBeanNames);\n}\n```\n\nadded for fixing a memory leak highlighted in the #16145 and released in Spring **3.2.9**.\n\nThe check inside the if condition:\n\n```java\nClassUtils.isCacheSafe(type, getBeanClassLoader())\n```\n\nreturns always false because:\n\n* **type** is an object of the EAR class loader\n* **getBeanClassLoader()** returns always the WAR class loader\n* the EAR class loader and the WAR class loader are different and they are sibling in the class loader hierarchy\n\nSo the following internal caches of the **DefaultListableBeanFactory** class:\n\n```java\n/** Map of singleton and non-singleton bean names, keyed by dependency type */\nprivate final Map<Class<?>, String[]> allBeanNamesByType = new ConcurrentHashMap<Class<?>, String[]>(64);\n\n/** Map of singleton-only bean names, keyed by dependency type */\nprivate final Map<Class<?>, String[]> singletonBeanNamesByType = new ConcurrentHashMap<Class<?>, String[]>(64);\n```\n\nwill always be empty and they will never be used.\n\nFurthermore informations:\n\n* The application server used is Wildfly 10.0.0.Final\n* The JDK used is JDK8 update 74.\n* I supposed that upgrading our application to the Spring 4.x or 5.x version will not fix the performance regression because the class loader check is still there.\n\n---\n\n**Affects:** 3.2.18, 4.3.16, 5.0.5\n\n**Attachments:**\n- [SPR_16714_short_term_solution_for_Spring_3.2.16.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/25474/SPR_16714_short_term_solution_for_Spring_3.2.16.zip) (_3.26 kB_)\n\n**Issue Links:**\n- #16145 Memory leak when using annotation based auto-wiring in child context\n\n**Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/46e3a919fed710fe9e3404f57a4e0d801e0685db, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/2989f01013f4983e9cb2c968cd619e598ab6543d, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/0efa7a05ad71ee33d89800810932760a5e8d2271, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/295929cc16f9ee48118c9903112b46aefdeaff55\n\n**Backported to:** [4.3.17](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/milestone/166?closed=1)\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tuxd3v/ats/issues/15","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tuxd3v/ats","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tuxd3v/ats/issues/15/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tuxd3v/ats/issues/15/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tuxd3v/ats/issues/15/events","html_url":"https://github.com/tuxd3v/ats/issues/15","id":526186763,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MjYxODY3NjM=","number":15,"title":"Install issu Buster -
