the `norwegianBokmålMessage` variable:\r\n- https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/blob/master/yesod-form/Yesod/Form/I18n/Norwegian.hs \r\n- https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/blob/master/yesod-auth/Yesod/Auth/Message.hs\r\n\r\nI would like to know if there is a special reason for the character `å` to be in the variable name and if you think it is the real reason why the hoogle/haddock fails. \r\nIf so, could this variable follow the same pattern as in the other i18n files, ex: `swedishFormMessage`

It turns out that this issue was caused by a [`Content-Security-Policy`](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security#content-security-policy) header that does not allow `unsafe-inline`, blocking inline JavaScript and instead throwing an error.\r\n\r\n![yesod-auth-logout-csp-violation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6189390/69907499-aeb24a00-139b-11ea-9f4d-47284ef2c679.png)\r\n\r\nTurns out that this issue is caused by the current implementation of [`redirectToPost`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yesod-core-1.6.16.1/docs/src/Yesod.Core.Handler.html#redirectToPost), which relies on an inline `<script>` tag.\r\n\r\n## My Attempted Solution\r\n\r\nI tried to refactor `redirectToPost`, currently implemented as:\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nredirectToPost :: (MonadHandler m, RedirectUrl (HandlerSite m) url)\r\n               => url\r\n               -> m a\r\nredirectToPost url = do\r\n    urlText <- toTextUrl url\r\n    req <- getRequest\r\n    withUrlRenderer [hamlet|\r\n$newline never\r\n$doctype 5\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n    <head>\r\n        <title>Redirecting...\r\n    <body>\r\n        <form id=\"form\" method=\"post\" action=#{urlText}>\r\n            $maybe token <- reqToken req\r\n                <input type=hidden name=#{defaultCsrfParamName} value=#{token}>\r\n            <noscript>\r\n                <p>Javascript has been disabled; please click on the button below to be redirected.\r\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Continue\">\r\n        <script>\r\n          window.onload = function() { document.getElementById('form').submit(); };\r\n|] >>= sendResponse\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy approach to eliminate the inline `<script>` tag was to convert the `window.onload` line to a widget and load it into the hamlet body. Here's what I tried to do:\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nredirectToPost :: (MonadHandler m, RedirectUrl (HandlerSite m) url)\r\n               => url\r\n               -> m a\r\nredirectToPost url = do\r\n    urlText <- toTextUrl url\r\n    req <- getRequest\r\n    pc <- widgetToPageContent $ toWidget $ [julius|window.onload = function() { document.getElementById('form').submit(); };|]\r\n    withUrlRenderer [hamlet|\r\n$newline never\r\n$doctype 5\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n    <head>\r\n        <title>Redirecting...\r\n    <body>\r\n        <form id=\"form\" method=\"post\" action=#{urlText}>\r\n            $maybe token <- reqToken req\r\n                <input type=hidden name=#{defaultCsrfParamName} value=#{token}>\r\n            <noscript>\r\n                <p>Javascript has been disabled; please click on the button below to be redirected.\r\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Continue\">\r\n        ^{pageBody pc}\r\n|] >>= sendResponse\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this approach would work, but `toWidget` is defined in `Yesod.Core.Widget`, which depends on `Yesod.Core.Handler` (the module with the change), so that's not really an option.\r\n\r\n## Another Possible Solution\r\n\r\nA different solution would be to make the `GET` handler (`getLogoutR`) delete the user's credentials, with no need for this intermediary page. Currently it is implemented as:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/blob/463fd54c5aaf1b7d6a1018095511c922302d6bef/yesod-auth/Yesod/Auth.hs#L468-L471\r\n\r\nThis approach was suggested in #1475 (for reasons unrelated to a CSP), but rejected, for the reason that `GET` requests should not modify server state.\r\n\r\n## How to Proceed\r\n\r\nI started my first-ever Yesod project a few months ago, and while I very much like the framework, I think one of the project's goals should be to strive for compatibility with modern web standards, especially ones related to security. A strict Content-Security-Policy is one of the examples of that. To quote Mozilla:\r\n\r\n> The use of this header is the best method to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.\r\n\r\nI understand the argument for not making `GET` requests modify server state.

One of the cases is actually easy to reproduce so I am reporting it here.  I think it points towards a problem in database marshaling.  In both cases, there was a hidden error or exception that caused the page not to load.  In the console I would only get the original page request and then nothin, no errors, and the page never loads.  The first time it happened it took me about 2 hours of changing code in all kinds of ways to finally see an Internal Server Error with a message that pointed me towards a solution.\n\nTo reproduce, create a fresh Yesod installation with MongoDB as the backend.  Create a persistent data type like so:\n\n```\nEnumTest\n    lookupId Int64\n    name Text\n    myOption MyEnum\n    UniqueEnumTest lookupId\n```\n\nMyEnum is a data type defined like so (I directly followed the Yesod book):\n\n``` haskell\ndata MyEnum = OptionOne | OptionTwo | OptionThree\n    deriving (Show, Read, Eq)\nderivePersistField \"MyEnum\"\n```\n\nThen modify the default getHomeR handler to insert the record into the database:\n\n``` haskell\ngetHomeR :: Handler Html\ngetHomeR = do\n    (formWidget, formEnctype) <- generateFormPost sampleForm\n    record <- runDB $ insert $ EnumTest 1 \"Test\" OptionOne\n    let submission = Nothing :: Maybe (FileInfo, Text)\n        handlerName = \"getHomeR\" :: Text\n    defaultLayout $ do\n        aDomId <- newIdent\n        setTitle \"Welcome To Yesod!\"\n        $(widgetFile \"homepage\")\n```\n\nHere's the data record in this case:\n\n```\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"55130d53aae39e14ec000000\"),\n    \"lookupId\" : NumberLong(1),\n    \"name\" : \"Test\",\n    \"myOption\" : \"OptionOne\"\n}\n```\n\nTo check if it works, replace the `runDB $ insert ...` line above with:\n\n``` haskell\n(Entity _ enumTest) <- runDB $ getBy404 $ UniqueEnumTest 1\n```\n\nIt will work fine.\n\nHowever, when you go into the database and change the value of the `myOption` field to a string that does NOT match any of the allowed options, Yesod will freeze when you try to refresh the page.  The only thing you'll get in the console will be:\n\n```\nGET /\n  Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, */*\n```\n\nThank you so much,\nMichal\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yesodweb/yesod/issues/767","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yesodweb/yesod","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yesodweb/yesod/issues/767/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yesodweb/yesod/issues/767/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yesodweb/yesod/issues/767/events","html_url":"https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/issues/767","id":37318025,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzMxODAyNQ==","number":767,"title":"Yesod eats 10-30% CPU when running idle in development","user":{"login":"darthdeus","id":123374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/123374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthdeus","html_url":"https://github.com/darthdeus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthdeus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthdeus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthdeus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthdeus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthdeus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthdeus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthdeus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthdeus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthdeus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":31,"created_at":"2014-07-07T22:50:22Z","updated_at":"2020-01-25T22:45:19Z","closed_at":"2020-01-25T22:45:19Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I've asked around on IRC and it seems I'm not the only one experiencing this.
