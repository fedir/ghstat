and @nicolas-grekas's [comment](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/22987#issuecomment-305791102) in #22987.\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\nThis PR introduces a new `server:dump` command available in the `VarDumper` component.\nConjointly with a new `ServerDumper` data dumper, it allows to send serialized `Data` clones to a single centralized server, in charge of dumping them on CLI output, or in an file in HTML format.\n\n## Showcase\n\n### HTTP calls\n\nFor instance, when working on an API and dumping something, you might end up with a mix of your response and the CLI dumped version of the data you asked:\n\n```php\nclass HelloController extends AbstractController\n{\n    /**\n     * @Route(\"/hello\")\n     */\n    public function hello(Request $request, UserInterface $user)\n    {\n        dump($request->attributes, $user);\n\n        return JsonResponse::create([\n            'status' => 'OK',\n            'message' => \"Hello {$user->getUsername()}\"\n        ]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<img width=\"732\" alt=\"screenshot 2017-08-08 a 16 44 24\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2211145/29077731-0b2152d6-7c59-11e7-99dd-2d060a906d48.PNG\">\n\nYou might even get the HTML dump version [under some conditions](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/DataCollector/DumpDataCollector.php#L146-L157).\n\nDumping to a server allows collecting dumps in a separate place:\n\n<!--![server-dumper-http-to-cli-output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2211145/29077977-8ace19ce-7c59-11e7-998e-ee9c49e67958.gif)-->\n\n![server-dump-http-to-cli](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2211145/29226044-dcc95f12-7ed0-11e7-8343-40aeb7b18dd5.gif)\n\n~⚠️ By swallowing the previous dumpers output, the dump data collector is not active when running the dump server. Disable swallowing if you want both.~ ➜ Dumps are still collected in the profiler thanks to f24712effc9fab1163c0053e2a0a0d5cc4f6473e\n\n### CLI calls\n\nThe best probably is (to me) that you can also debug CLI applications...\n\n![server-dump-cli](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2211145/29225951-84e29098-7ed0-11e7-8067-abaa9c50d169.gif)\n\n<!--![server-dumper-cli-to-cli-output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2211145/29078261-1eb950ea-7c5a-11e7-94ee-aa3ae3bf7fb0.gif)-->\n\n...and get HTML formatted dumps:\n\n![server-dumper-cli-to-html-output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2211145/30784609-d7dc19b8-a158-11e7-9b11-88ae819cfcca.gif)\n\n<!--![server-dump-cli-to-html](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2211145/29225866-2b5675e4-7ed0-11e7-98eb-339611bd94a7.gif)-->\n\n<!--![server-dumper-cli-to-html-output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2211145/29078247-17e33e5c-7c5a-11e7-94f7-47de6774e0e8.gif)-->\n\nhence, benefit from all the features of this format (collapse, search, ...)\n\n### HTML output at a glance\n\n<img width=\"831\" alt=\"screenshot 2017-08-11 a 19 28 25\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2211145/29225513-eae349f2-7ece-11e7-9861-8cda9e80ba7f.PNG\">\n\nThe HTML output benefits from all the `HtmlDumper` features and contains extra informations about the context (sources, requests, command line, ...). It doesn't aim to replace the profiler for HTTP calls with the framework, but is really handy for CLI apps or by wiring it in your own web app, out of the framework usage.\n\n### CLI output at a glance\n\n<img width=\"829\" alt=\"screenshot 2017-08-11 a 19 52 57\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2211145/29225482-c24afe18-7ece-11e7-8e83-d019b0d8303e.PNG\">\n\n## Usage within the framework\n\n### Config\n\nFor instance, in your `config_dev.yml`:\n\n```yml\n#config_dev.yml\ndebug:\n    server_dump: true\n```\n\nor in your `config.yml`:\n\n```yml\n#config.yml\ndebug:\n    server_dump: '%kernel.debug%'\n```\n\n~~The configuration also allows to set a `host` option, but there is already a sensible default value (`tcp://0.0.0.0:9912`) so you don't have to deal with it.~~ Since b002175, in case you want to change the default host value used, simply use the `VAR_DUMPER_SERVER` env var.\n\nWhen the server is running, all dumps are collected by the server and previous dumpers ones are \"swallowed\" ~~by default. If you want both to collect dumps on the server AND keep previous dumpers on regular outputs, you can disable swallowing:~~\n\n<!--\n```yml\ndebug:\n    server_dump:\n        swallow: false\n```\n-->\n\nWhen the server isn't running or in case of failure to send the data clones to the server, the server dumper will delegates to the configured wrapped dumper, so dumps are displayed and collected as usual.\n\n### Running the server\n\n```bash\nbin/console server:dump [--format=cli|html]\n```\n\n#### Options\n\n- ~~The `output` option defaults to `null` which will display dumps on CLI. It accepts a file path in which dumps will be collected in HTML format.~~\n- The `format` option allows to switch format to use. For instance, use the `html` format and redirect the output to a file in order to open it in your browser and inspect dumps in HTML format.\n- ~~The default `host` value is the same as the one configured under the `debug.server_dump.host` config option, so you don't have to deal with it in most cases.~~\n    Since b002175, in case you want to change the default host value used, simply use the `VAR_DUMPER_SERVER` env var:\n\n    ```bash\n    VAR_DUMPER_SERVER=0.0.0.0:9204 bin/console server:dump\n    ```\n\n## Manual wiring\n\nIf you want to wire it yourself in your own project or using it to inspect dumps as html before the kernel is even boot for instance:\n\n```php\n$host = 'tcp://0.0.0.0:9912'; // use null to read from the VAR_DUMPER_SERVER env var\n$cloner = new VarCloner();\n$dumper = new ServerDumper($host, new CliDumper());\n\nVarDumper::setHandler(function ($var) use ($dumper, $cloner) {\n    $dumper->dump($cloner->cloneVar($var));\n});\n```\n\n## Create your own server app\n\nThe component already provides a default server app by means of the `ServerDumpCommand`, but\n you could also build your own by using the `DumpServer`:\n\n```php\n$host = 'tcp://0.0.0.0:9912'; // use null to read from the VAR_DUMPER_SERVER env var\n\n$server = new DumpServer($host);\n\n$server->start();\n\n$server->listen(function (Data $data, array $context, $clientId) {\n    // do something\n});\n```\n\nCommits\n-------\n\n138dad6440 [VarDumper] Some tweaks after Nicolas' commit & ServerDumperPlaceholderCommand\n088c52ed70 [VarDumper] Review config to
