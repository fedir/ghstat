the global scope.\n\nFor ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval\n> If you use the eval function indirectly, by invoking it via a reference other than eval, as of ECMAScript 5 it works in the global scope rather than the local scope. This means, for instance, that function declarations create global functions, and that the code being evaluated doesn't have access to local variables within the scope where it's being called.\n\nCommits\n-------\n\n0cd51ae267 [Profiler] Fix dump makes toolbar

transport. By making `TransportInterface` a first class citizen, we simplify the wiring logic, we allow sharing the same connection for both the sender and the receiver, and we provide a natural point to lazily create the connection.\n\nLive from Las Vegas :)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/243674/39658543-93c7120c-4fca-11e8-9f11-797953b3ee98.png)\n\nCommits\n-------\n\n379b8eb56b
