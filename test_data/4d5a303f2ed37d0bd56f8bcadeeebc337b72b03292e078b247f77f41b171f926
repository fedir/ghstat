Why not to send an updated/created model as a third argument to checkAccess() (in $params)? The same goes for CreateAction.\r\n\r\nLet's say I work with User model and property user_role can be set to \"admin\" by superadmin only. If regular user is trying to set that value then it's reasonable to throw Forbidden exception. I would consider checkAccess() function is a appropriate place to throw forbidden exception rather than in model validator (because user_role can have \"admin\" value set, it just has to be set by user with enough access permissions).\r\n\r\n>checkAccess is used to determine whether a user is allowed to call a specific action.
