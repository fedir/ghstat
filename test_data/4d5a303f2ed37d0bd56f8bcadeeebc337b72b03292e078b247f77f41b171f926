From field should be equal to username by default\r\n1. We should have an option to provide default headers from mailer component config array\r\n1. We need to create custom Mailer component that replaces, for example, `yii\\swiftmailer\\Mailer` that explicitly sets `setFrom()` to be equal to that of a `transport` `username` during calling of `compose()` method\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      |
