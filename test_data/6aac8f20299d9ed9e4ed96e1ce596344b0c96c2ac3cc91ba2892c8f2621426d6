I think soeone else had similar problems, I want to import a single component, and not a library of 1 component... hmm\r\n\r\nBarrie Hadfield @barriehadfield 05:56\r\nHey @fkchang thanks for trying it all out and for the feedback. Looks like you got everything sorted in the end but onbiously the docs need some realy imporvement. Fred and I are deep into the new website which loads all its pages dynamically, so has a ‘Improve this page’ button on each page making it super easy to improve. I think this will help us all! Also we have not yet, but need to really write more about using JS libs and components in Hyperloop - there are many tricks!\r\n\r\nBarrie Hadfield @barriehadfield 06:01\r\nFor your undefined method run' for Object, that is a Hyperloop bug where the Component is for some reason being treated as an Operation. If you specifically wrap the library\r\nclass ReactReact < Hyperloop::Component\r\n  imports ‘Panel'\r\nend\r\nit will work peroperly. Actually I now follow the convention of ReactPanel = require(..) and then class Panel…..imports ‘ReactPanel’\r\nWhat you figures out with Pabellib::Panel is 100% right. (Well you can do it either way. Importing PanelLib obviously brings all of the lib whereas ReactPanel=require(..).Panel brings in just hat one component, which you might want to de depending on size of output.\r\nHere is one that I hope you can explain, as it is a mystery to me. I bet you that Card.Content and Card.Header are CardContent and CardHeader, the former will not work and the latter will. I have no idea why this would be the case but it is my experience. (Perhaps different in the lib you are using though - wuld love to know).\r\n\r\nBarrie Hadfield @barriehadfield 06:12\r\nPRE-RENDER: I am up early this morning to spend some time trying different ways of adding a pre-render step to the final build process. It has turned out to be more complicated than I thought it would be as basically you have to get the whole site running on Node server side then call your routes cand capture their output HTML and write it to a series of files. My current (about to start) path is https://github.com/fiatjaf/sitio which albeit new makes some sense… Have you any experience/advice here?\r\n\r\nBarrie Hadfield @barriehadfield 06:52\r\nActually having a better time with https://github.com/iansinnott/react-static-webpack-plugin\r\n\r\nBarrie Hadfield @barriehadfield 08:08\r\nSo, I now know how the static generators work, I am thinking that it would be best to write one in ruby - what do you think?","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyperloop-config/issues/14","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyperloop-config","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyperloop-config/issues/14/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyperloop-config/issues/14/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyperloop-config/issues/14/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/hyperloop-config/issues/14","id":301602082,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMDE2MDIwODI=","number":14,"title":"Implement
