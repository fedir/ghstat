I can insert the jupyter notebook contents now, but it's scrolled up. \r\n\r\n- For instance, one of my blogs is at:\r\n[https://longervision.github.io/2018/04/01/CNN-by-PyTorch/](https://longervision.github.io/2018/04/01/CNN-by-PyTorch/) \r\nThere are 2 pieces of ipynb snippets in this blog.\r\n\r\n- As a comparison, I found another blog [http://blog.qiliuxiansheng.com/](http://blog.qiliuxiansheng.com/). The ipynb snippets on that blog spreads out beautifully. \r\n\r\n\r\nSince both blogs use the same hexo plugin [hexo-jupyter-notebook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-jupyter-notebook), I guess the **scrolling** difference is from **hexo**, but not from this plugin itself. So, I wonder how to **NOT scrolling up my .ipynb snippet\" ?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much\r\nPei\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nPei\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo/issues/3106","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo/issues/3106/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo/issues/3106/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo/issues/3106/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues/3106","id":310392275,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTAzOTIyNzU=","number":3106,"title":"[Feature Request]  keywords optimization for SEO","user":{"login":"xu-song","id":13825126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODI1MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13825126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xu-song","html_url":"https://github.com/xu-song","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xu-song/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xu-song/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xu-song/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xu-song/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xu-song/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xu-song/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xu-song/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xu-song/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xu-song/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-04-02T04:30:29Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T23:40:54Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T23:40:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\nThank you for reporting an issue.

In the above example, there are many overlap between `keywords` and `tags`.\r\n\r\nIn SEO aspect, `keywords` should contains `tags` by default, `keywords > tags`.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\n\r\n1.  `keywords` contains `page.tags`\r\n```js\r\nconst keywords = page.keywords.concate(page.tags) || config.keywords;\r\n```\r\n2.  `keywords` contains
