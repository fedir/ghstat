I would use something similar to [this](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/simple-image-render-hook-template-for-responsive-images/22464).\r\n\r\nThe issue is that ox-hugo wraps images in the hugo `figure` shortcode, and from reading thus far I am led to believe render hooks cannot process shortcodes (related to this issue: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/6703).\r\n\r\nI would prefer to keep using the simplicity afforded by ox-hugo, currently I can just use org-download to drag images in, caption them with org syntax, etc. \r\n\r\nOne idea I have is modifying the default [figure shortcode](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/shortcodes/figure.html), adding an image processing step and a lazy load attribute.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any

Make clean new site with `blogdown::new_site()`\r\n\r\n2. Add `.Rprofile` to the project folder with this content:\r\n\r\n```r\r\noptions(\r\n  blogdown.serve_site.startup = FALSE,  # automatically serve the site on RStudio startup\r\n  blogdown.knit.on_save = FALSE  # automatically knit Rmd on save\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Restart R so that it picks up the new options and doesn't automatically start the server\r\n\r\n4. Run either `blogdown:::serve_site()` (or use RStudio add-in menu) to start the server (or with `blogdown:::preview_site()`)\r\n\r\n5. Edit one of the default R Markdown files and knit with ⌘⇧K (or button in RStudio)\r\n\r\n6.

We strongly suggest that you test your theme with the [Hugo Themes Build Script](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md#testing-a-theme-with-the-hugo-themes-website-build-script) before submitting the theme for review.

If a theme demo breaks and remains broken then at some point it will be removed from the list without prior warning.
