Studio. CDM Qualification Function would likely achieve this (build pending). Alternatively a new PrimitiveEvent could be modelled for KIs/KOs. WG discussed having an identifier for who is the exercising party, for which it was suggested the Party information can be used to derive this though. Partial Exercises were also considered for which the current CDM model could accommodate by use of the before and after contract data messages which would contain a quantityTransfer (could be an exotic use case for Stage 3 of the Pilot).\r\n\r\n## Action Items\r\n- [ ] Action 1: Attempt to model alternative KnockIn/KnockOut events in Studio to share in next WG - Vijay\r\n- [ ] Action 2: Stage 2 testing of lifecycle modelling via Studio - Vijay\r\n\r\n### WebEx info\r\n- Meeting link: https://finos.webex.com/finos/j.phpMTID=m9989b4e8a8a07ed8677e35cf4bb879cd\r\n- Meeting number: 667 055 449\r\n- Password: CWfvDt6yA36\r\n- Join by video system: Dial 667055449@finos.webex.com.

That means it needs to be embeddable in different sytems (Rails, React, maybe Nuxt), which means it should not be written in any framework. To that end, I am investigating SvelteJS, which compiles down to plain JavaScript. The widget itself is not very difficult, but figuring out the technology to make it cross-platform embeddable will take some time.\n\n*Update:* I ultimately was able to build an embeddable widget in SvelteJS, but the bundled size of it was nearly the size of the Knockout framework. I opted to use Knockout instead. It is easy to plug into Rails.\n\n## Testing harness\nSteve made a simple Rails app for trying it out:\nhttps://github.com/steveburkett/railsplugintest\n\n## To do\n- [x] Create the widget within the test harness\n- [x] Put the widget in a separate package\n- [x] Use the package in the test harness, instead of a local version\n- [x] Add styling to the Pattern Library\n- [x] Apply PL styling to the instance in the harness","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/finos/legend/issues/179","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/finos/legend","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/finos/legend/issues/179/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/finos/legend/issues/179/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/finos/legend/issues/179/events","html_url":"https://github.com/finos/legend/issues/179","id":654180555,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NTQxODA1NTU=","number":179,"title":"FX Options WG meeting -

These are used to qualify a product, event etc using relevant primitives. The WG reviewed a proposed KI function in Studio which was agreed would facilitate KI event qualification. The WG will revisit this at future date once full functionality to model and submit functions in Alloy Studio is available.\r\n\r\n- Suggestion raised for FxDigitalOption modelling, which could be considered as part of Stage 3 of the pilot. \r\n\r\n- Participants trying the Mapping and Testing features of Studio suggested tool enhancement for not needing to define explicit mappings for classes that share common data - ticket raised: https://gitlab.alloy.finos.org/alloy-pilot/cdm/-/issues/9\r\n\r\n## Action Items\r\n- [ ] Vijay - to follow up on additional features available in Studio for demo'ing in an upcoming bi-weekly Alloy meeting.\r\n- [ ] Vijay - to review concepts and classes for Stage 3 and FxDigitalOption consideration.\r\n\r\n### WebEx info\r\n- Meeting link: https://finos.webex.com/finos/j.phpMTID=m9989b4e8a8a07ed8677e35cf4bb879cd\r\n- Meeting number: 667 055 449\r\n- Password: CWfvDt6yA36\r\n- Join by video system: Dial 667055449@finos.webex.com.

There's separate [bundles](https://github.com/riipah/vocadb/blob/master/VocaDbWeb/App_Start/BundleConfig.cs) for all main views, in addition to a couple of shared bundles. As the number of JavaScript files grows, managing dependencies is increasingly becoming a problem. We don't want to include all JavaScript files on all pages, and the files need to be included in the right order, so managing the bundles becomes complicated. \r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nNowadays [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html) and EcmaScript (JavaScript) include built-in support for modules. Dependencies can be defined by importing modules.\r\n\r\nWhen all dependencies are defined with import/export, a module bundling tool like Webpack can be used to create the bundles.\r\n\r\nOf course this would be nearly impossible to do at once, so if we are to consider using Webpack, it has to be done somehow incrementally per file. Knockout includes some support for dynamically loading modules, but since VocaDB isn't a SPA (except for maybe the search page), it would be ok to include bundles per ASP.NET page. \r\n\r\nIdeally we'd have one big bundle for common dependencies, plus page-specific bundles for page's viewmodels, similar to current ASP.NET bundles. For example, \"bundles/main\", which includes files used on most pages, \"bundles/song/edit\", which includes files on song/edit page (SongEditViewModel.ts + /song/edit.ts + their dependencies).","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
