The router is used as a captive portal, in that anyone connecting to the router will be redirected to the webserver.  This is done via iptables.\r\n\r\nThe webserver has a login page.  After login the internet is opened for the client via iptables.\r\n\r\nI have tried connecting using 2 devices.  Things work well for about 10 minutes. Then the network just hangs.  The router becomes unreachable from the linux box ie cannot ping gateway.\r\n\r\nI am at a loss as to how to even narrow down the problem.  Things I have tried:  \r\n\r\n1) catch and print every error in the webserver.  use callbacks consistently.  These show no errors and the webserver does not crash.\r\n2) check memory and cpu usage using top.  These are also ok, with very low cpu usage (peak usage 1 percent) and memory usage of about 1 percent\r\n3) tcpdump.  when the network drops, I can see a bunch of who-has tell.  I am new to tcpdump.\r\n4) on failure ifconfig shows the correct static ip for the ubuntu web server.  But pinging the router fails.\r\n\r\nIts kind of a vague problem, where I am not even able to narrow it down.  Any help, pointers appreciated.

this might not be an issue with express' internal workings, as I did post this up on stackoverflow initially thinking that this issue was purely arising from how I am approaching using express, but after experimenting with multiple setups I'm not so sure what's what. Currently I have a setup for hot reloading as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// server.js\r\nconst app = express();\r\n\r\napp.use(function (req, res, next) {\r\n    require('./server/index')(req, res, next);\r\n    require('./server/foo')(req, res, next); // another url page\r\n});\r\n```\r\nEach require file inside app.use follows the following example template:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst router = express.Router();\r\n\r\nrouter.get('whatever endpoint' you want, (req, res) => {\r\n  console.log('whatever endpoint you want');\r\n  res.send('whatever message you want');\r\n});\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = router;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that app.use with just a callback will apply to every possible route. And if a user navigates to a route that doesn't exist, say '/bar' for example, express' cannot GET/ should be displayed at whatever the incorrect endpoint was.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happens however, is that express crashes with the ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT error. So of course that's bad, so to get around that, I would just apply my own catch-all inside the above app.use at the end of the function as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//server.js\r\napp.use(function (req, res, next) {\r\n    require('./server/index')(req, res, next);\r\n    require('./server/foo')(req, res, next); \r\n    require('./server/catch-all')(req, res, next);\r\n});\r\n\r\n//catch-all.js\r\nrouter.get('*', (req, res) => {    \r\n  console.log('catch all');\r\n  if(!res.headersSent){ // this is necessary to prevent the ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT error\r\n    res.redirect('/');\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fixes all of the issues, but I've noticed that the catch-all console.log is always called twice; once for when the rest of the require statements have been called and it has not found a match, hence using the catch-all endpoint. The second is for when the redirect to the main page happens.\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is correct, since app.use() is being called for every single request, this causes the double call effect when invoked by the redirect handler? If so, if we omit the catch-all, and go back to what was originally done at the top of this post, why does express crash with the ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT error? Is it again because of the app.use being called for every route, including routes that aren't defined and being handled by cannot GET? \r\n\r\nIf this is the case, and this is the crux of what I'm trying to get at, shouldn't express internally recognise that the cannot get / error handler has already been called? It seems like it's attempting to send two responses that both say cannot GET whatever page the error is on, hence the ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT error.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is splitting the above into two separate app.use calls, that _only_ handle specific routes:\r\n\r\n```\r\napp.use('/', require('./server/index'));\r\napp.use('/foo', require('./server/foo'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if you have numerous routes, having loads of app.use calls littering your code becomes repetitive, and your docs state both options as being valid. Is it just a case of it needing to be done this way by design or am I perhaps missing another possible option? \r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3583","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3583/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3583/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3583/events","html_url":"https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/3583","id":302762253,"number":3583,"title":"cookie-signature dependency has timing vulnerability","user":{"login":"drewjenkins","id":5521743,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5521743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewjenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/drewjenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewjenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewjenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewjenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewjenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewjenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewjenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewjenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewjenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewjenkins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2018-03-06T16:07:09Z","updated_at":"2018-03-15T02:44:09Z","closed_at":"2018-03-06T16:32:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"See https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:cookie-signature:20180111 for details.\r\n\r\nTo resolve, upgrade the cookie-parser dependency to 1.1.0 or above","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3581","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3581/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3581/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3581/events","html_url":"https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/3581","id":301642064,"number":3581,"title":"Connecting to a database in app.js","user":{"login":"shipagency","id":36870314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/36870314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shipagency","html_url":"https://github.com/shipagency","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shipagency/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shipagency/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shipagency/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shipagency/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shipagency/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shipagency/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shipagency/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shipagency/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shipagency/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":133578712,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-03-02T03:32:40Z","updated_at":"2018-03-02T03:40:33Z","closed_at":"2018-03-02T03:34:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am writing a new app, and one of the requirements is that I use the \"straight\" express boilerplate that include `bin/www` and an `app.js`.\r\n\r\nI normally just merge the two of them for convenience.
