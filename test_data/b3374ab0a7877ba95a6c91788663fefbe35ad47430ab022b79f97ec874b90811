all,\r\n\r\nI encountered a strange issue when defining routes in an async function that uses await. In the simplified example below, I define a GET endpoint and an error handler that formats the error. The error handler will not run if there is an await statement in the defineRoutes function. \r\n\r\n```\r\nconst express = require('express');\r\n\r\nconst app = express();\r\n\r\ndefineRoutes(app);\r\n\r\napp.use((err, req, res, next) => {\r\n    res.status(400).send({ error_code: 'FAILED' });\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.listen(8080);\r\n\r\nasync function defineRoutes(app) {\r\n    await \"\"; // Removing this line allows the error handler to run properly\r\n\r\n    app.get('/test', (req, res, next) => {\r\n        return next(new Error('Something happened'));\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefining the error handler within the defineRoutes function works fine:\r\n```\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nconst express = require('express');\r\n\r\nconst app = express();\r\n\r\ndefineRoutes(app);\r\n\r\napp.listen(8080);\r\n\r\nasync function defineRoutes(app) {\r\n    await \"\";\r\n\r\n    app.get('/test', (req, res, next) => {\r\n        return next(new Error('Something happened'));\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {\r\n        res.status(400).send({ error_code: 'FAILED' });\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nCan anyone shed some light as to what is going on?","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3612","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3612/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3612/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/3612/events","html_url":"https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/3612","id":310398447,"number":3612,"title":"npm install issue  (ENOENT)","user":{"login":"drsmog","id":7422971,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7422971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drsmog","html_url":"https://github.com/drsmog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drsmog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drsmog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drsmog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drsmog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drsmog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drsmog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drsmog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drsmog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drsmog/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2018-04-02T05:25:46Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T11:09:53Z","closed_at":"2018-04-14T16:14:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"cant install. any ideas ?\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\isvanidze\\Desktop\\testexpress\r\nλ npm install express\r\nnpm WARN enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\\Users\\isvanidze\\Desktop\\testexpress\\package.json'\r\nnpm WARN testexpress No description\r\nnpm WARN testexpress No repository field.\r\nnpm WARN testexpress No README data\r\nnpm WARN testexpress No license field.\r\n\r\nnpm ERR! path C:\\Users\\isvanidze\\Desktop\\testexpress\\node_modules\\content-type\r\nnpm ERR! code ENOENT\r\nnpm ERR! errno -4058\r\nnpm ERR! syscall rename\r\nnpm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, rename 'C:\\Users\\isvanidze\\Desktop\\testexpress\\node_modules\\content-type' -> 'C:\\Users\\isvanidze\\Desktop\\testexpress\\node_modules\\.content-type.DELETE'\r\nnpm ERR! enoent This is related to npm not being able to find a file.\r\nnpm ERR! enoent\r\n\r\nnpm ERR!
