(The response body is being relayed properly.)\r\n\r\nI'm a little confused because I would have thought that the default behavior for an HTTP proxy like this would be to forward the whole response, as constructed by the application web server.\r\n\r\nI've got a simple routine like the following:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n  get \"/test\" do\r\n    \"http://example.com\"\r\n    |> request\r\n    |> response\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the `response` function\r\n\r\n- Responds to the client with the 200 response code and the basic Cowboy headers\r\n- Fires the request to example.com\r\n- Proxies the response body from the proxied app to the client's response\r\n\r\nIt's not even obvious how I would split this up... It seems I want to call example.com, THEN fill out the client response?\r\n\r\nDoesn't it make sense that I would want to preserve the code & headers from the app when proxying with Rackla? I would love a hint as to why my expectation is wrong and/or how I might accomplish this with Rackla.\r\n\r\nIn any case, thank you for sharing your work on this library!
