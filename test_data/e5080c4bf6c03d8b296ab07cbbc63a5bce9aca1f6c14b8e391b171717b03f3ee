Description\r\n\r\nAs discussed at https://github.com/google/web-stories-wp/pull/4671#issuecomment-709966538, the goal of the embed block's `save` component is to provide a fallback so that there's still some content when the user deactivates the plugin.\r\n\r\nThe current output - `<amp-story-player>` - fails to do that because we don't print the necessary JavaScript with it. And we cannot print the necessary JavaScript because it requires `unfiltered_html` caps.\r\n\r\nSo we should be saving something else!\r\n\r\nPossibilities:\r\n\r\n* Just print the story URL as a fallback (like some other embed blocks do)\r\n* Print the story with an image as fallback (could be using `Image` class)  \r\n  _This would be very similar to #3879 / #3868 - almost a resurrection of that work_\r\n\r\nI _think_ using the `Image` class should be fine, so let's try that.\r\n\r\n**Important consideration**: this change requires block deprecation.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives Considered\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n## Additional Context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request. -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Do not alter or remove anything below.

I was excited to include RelocaTE and RelocaTE2 but sadly these are the programs that are giving me the most headaches.\r\n\r\nEverything runs smoothly on the test data after installation, I haven't seen any problems in the log outputs there. However, when I run the pipeline on my own data, both default and specifying specific programs, there are some problems. RelocaTE shows output in the log file but takes a really long time, I ran the default pipeline for 120 hours on our remote cluster and it timed out before RelocaTE was finished when every other program was complete hours after I started the job (except RelocaTE2, but I'll explain). The fastq files are larger, 7.5 GB for each of the paired-ends, but with multi-threading this seems too long.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, RelocaTE2 runs indefinitely, but there's almost no information I can gather about where the problem is occurring. This is the log file I have so far after running the pipeline with just trimgalore and RelocaTE2 for nearly 48 hours (and all of this text was available after 30 minutes of run time).\r\n\r\noutput/48_all\r\nJob counts:\r\n\tcount\tjobs\r\n\t1\tindex_reference_genome\r\n\t1\tmake_consensus_fasta\r\n\t1\tmake_reference_fasta\r\n\t1\tmap_reads\r\n\t1\tmedian_insert_size\r\n\t1\trelocaTE2_post\r\n\t1\trelocaTE2_run\r\n\t1\trepeatmask\r\n\t1\tsetup_reads\r\n\t1\tsummary_report\r\n\t10\r\nPROCESSING       making consensus fasta\r\nPROCESSING       consensus fasta created\r\nPROCESSING       making reference fasta\r\nPROCESSING       reference fasta created\r\nPROCESSING       making samtools and bwa index files for reference fasta &> /gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/test_48/48_relocate/logs/20200720.120349.7542720/processing.log\r\nPROCESSING       samtools and bwa index files for reference fasta created\r\nPROCESSING       prepping reads for McClintock\r\nPROCESSING       running trim_galore &> /gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/test_48/48_relocate/logs/20200720.120349.7542720/trimgalore.log\r\nPROCESSING       read setup complete\r\nPROCESSING       Running RepeatMasker for RelocaTE2 &> /gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/test_48/48_relocate/logs/20200720.120349.7542720/processing.log\r\nPROCESSING       Repeatmasker for RelocaTE2 complete\r\nPROCESSING       mapping reads to reference &> /gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/test_48/48_relocate/logs/20200720.120349.7542720/bwa.log\r\nPROCESSING       read mapping complete\r\nPROCESSING       calculating median insert size of reads\r\nPROCESSING       median insert size of reads calculated\r\nConda environment defines Python version < 3.5.

I did notice that while the last line looks like an error:\r\n`Conda environment defines Python version < 3.5. Using Python of the master process to execute script. Note that this cannot be avoided, because the script uses data structures from Snakemake which are Python >=3.5 only.`\r\n\r\nThis line also present in the log output of the entire McClintock pipeline on the test dataset but not present in the RelocaTE2 log output. I'm wondering then how RelocaTE2 completely stalls or runs indefinitely without any visible progress when it works on the test data. The only other clue I can give is the error message that is given when the job hits the time limit. But I see similar kinds of error messages when I stop the pipeline prematurely in general. \r\n\r\nRuleException:\r\nCalledProcessError in line 578 of /gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/snakemake/3427427/Snakefile:\r\nCommand 'source /scratch/lhemmer/programs/miniconda3/bin/activate '/gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/install/envs/conda/32bdc8a2'; set -euo pipefail;  /scratch/lhemmer/programs/miniconda3/envs/mcclintock/bin/python3.8 /gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/snakemake/3427427/.snakemake/scripts/tmp70q2ux3x.relocate2_run.py' died with <Signals.SIGTERM: 15>.\r\n  File \"/gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/snakemake/3427427/Snakefile\", line 578, in __rule_relocaTE2_run\r\n  File \"/scratch/lhemmer/programs/miniconda3/envs/mcclintock/lib/python3.8/concurrent/futures/thread.py\", line 57, in run\r\nRuleException:\r\nCalledProcessError in line 525 of /gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/snakemake/3427427/Snakefile:\r\nCommand 'source /scratch/lhemmer/programs/miniconda3/bin/activate '/gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/install/envs/conda/272a644b'; set -euo pipefail;  /scratch/lhemmer/programs/miniconda3/envs/mcclintock/bin/python3.8 /gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/snakemake/3427427/.snakemake/scripts/tmppmwkuerv.relocate_run.py' died with <Signals.SIGTERM: 15>.\r\n  File \"/gpfs/fs2/scratch/alarracu_lab/Lucas/mcclintock/snakemake/3427427/Snakefile\", line 525, in __rule_relocaTE_run\r\n  File \"/scratch/lhemmer/programs/miniconda3/envs/mcclintock/lib/python3.8/concurrent/futures/thread.py\", line 57, in run\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated, and if there are any additional outputs or files you need let me know.
