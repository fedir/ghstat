When I adding a user via `http://localhost:1337/admin/plugins/content-manager/user/create?source=users-permissions`, `bcrypt.hash` will work (`bcryptjs` is neither mentioned in the `package.json` file nor installed in `node_modules` folder. ), skip the checking process, and save into the database directly as a plain text.\r\n\r\nSo, when I tried to log in via `POST http://localhost:1337/auth/local`, it'll throw an error: `Identifier or password invalid.`.\r\n\r\nStrangely, If I use an admin credential, it'll work just fine, and save into database with a hashed password.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce the problem**\r\n\r\n- Create a new app using [this instruction] (https://strapi.io/documentation/getting-started/quick-start.html)\r\n- Create admin user.\r\n- Create some random account using admin backend.\r\n- Check the database.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should ~~~either~~~:\r\n- ~~Throw an error about `bcrypt`. Or ~~\r\n- Hash the password properly\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**\r\nI check using `console.log`  and found that value send to `User.add` service (Path: `\\plugins\\users-permissions\\services\\User.js`) is in this form: \r\n ```js\r\n{ fields: { username: 'aasss', email: 'aa@ss.co', password: '111111' },\r\n  files: {} }\r\n```\r\nBut the logic used to check password exist was: (line 21)\r\n```js\r\nif (values.password) {\r\n      values.password = await strapi.plugins['users-permissions'].services.user.hashPassword(values);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, IMO, this line should be changed to: \r\n```js\r\nif (values.password) {\r\n    
8000
  values.password = await strapi.plugins['users-permissions'].services.user.hashPassword(values);\r\n    }else if(values.fields.password) {\r\n      values.fields.password = await
