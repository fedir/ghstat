passed from URL is not parsed as `pagination` param, but parsed as where condition ?\r\n\r\nSo is there any configuration where i can set the pagination param field, so the

I always get this error:\r\n```\r\n[2018-05-06T10:55:11.231Z] error Cast to ObjectId failed for value \"[ { _id: '5aeedea8ec354f181944cd73',\r\n    username: 'bozho',\r\n    password: 'password',\r\n    email: 'my_email@gmail.com',\r\n    provider: 'local',\r\n    role: '5aeede8dec354f181944cca1',\r\n    __v: 0,\r\n    articles: null,\r\n    id: '5aeedea8ec354f181944cd73' } ]\" at path \"author\"\r\n```\r\nTried also with different versions of node, mongo etc. \r\nI noticed that I can add an author by going to Users, and for a selected user to add article and save. But, then when I go to the article (with the relation) page the front end brakes and there are [multiple errors in the console](https://ibb.co/hd7i67)\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that when I do a graphql query for an article with an author like this:\r\n```\r\nexport const query = graphql`  \r\n  query ArticleTemplate($id: String!) {\r\n    strapiArticle(id: {eq: $id}) {\r\n      title\r\n      content\r\n      author {\r\n        id\r\n        username\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n`\r\n```\r\nI get the expected results, which that the relationship is created by going to a User page and associating an article with the User. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the problem**\r\nFollow the Gatsby-Strapi tutorial. \r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe expected error is to be able to add content type with relational field.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Suggested solutions**\r\nI don't have a solution, I careful wen through all the steps many times and the error always happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- ⚠️ Make sure to browse the opened and closed issues. -->\r\nI browsed all open and closed issues and I didn't find this exact error referenced or solved. \r\n\r\n- [x ] I'm sure that this feature hasn't already been referenced.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n⬆️ Don't delete this checkbox from your issue and approve it.\r\nAdd an `x` ->  [x] or click on the checkbox when your issue is created.\r\n-->\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/1129","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/1129/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/1129/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/1129/events","html_url":"https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/1129","id":320569634,"number":1129,"title":"Browser New Window Title has always \"Strai - \", Where Can I remove text ?
