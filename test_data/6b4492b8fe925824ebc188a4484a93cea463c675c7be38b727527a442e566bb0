working on a Roadiz theme (in a theme powered by this CMS or Framework), but I've some problem, like knowing PHP or CSS compiler system. So, I found an idea : Why not making discussions on a forum ?\r\n\r\n**Goals** : \r\n- Making work with Roadiz easier and not pollute Github Issues system. \r\n- Discussion about support, about website, about PHP/JS/CSS/SCSS/New features.\r\n- Introduction of existing Working website, Themes : Ideas ?\r\n- and because we need that : Roadiz is a bit complex, but with motivation we could make big work.\r\n\r\nI know it could make problem to you company, Rezo Zero, which is one, from my point of view, of the BEST company which works for developing Website. But there are many **advantages** for you in making one : \r\n- Making ads for Roadiz, as the best software, still in beta.\r\n- Developing new features for Roadiz, because Ads = New Users = New Devs = New Features/Better Security/Internationalization = more Websites = more ads ... \r\n- Motivation for ppl who doesn't know what is Roadiz... Complicated to have a website with roadiz, but \"let's see if backend is so complicated when ppl help me\".\r\n- Open a market and you could want in a future to extend Roadiz.\r\n\r\n**We have already Gitter ! Why a forum ? who will maintain it ? No time for it ?**:\r\n- Gitter is good but we need to scroll up to see old discussion, and I saw many time that persons had problem with the same origin or which are not so different.\r\n- A forum is more attractive\r\n- Maintaining a forum can be made by dev at the beginning but can quickly evolved to a community forum where the maintainers will be persons of the community.\r\n\r\nSo, could it be good to have a forum ? It's just an idea, \"not because every communities have one\", but because it's strategical.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your answer,\r\nfrju365\r\n\r\nPS: sorry for my bad english. :)\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roadiz/roadiz/issues/296","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roadiz/roadiz","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roadiz/roadiz/issues/296/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roadiz/roadiz/issues/296/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roadiz/roadiz/issues/296/events","html_url":"https://github.com/roadiz/roadiz/issues/296","id":294193741,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTQxOTM3NDE=","number":296,"title":"Cant't reach install.php","user":{"login":"WWWorksnl","id":6491365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTEzNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6491365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WWWorksnl","html_url":"https://github.com/WWWorksnl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WWWorksnl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WWWorksnl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WWWorksnl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WWWorksnl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WWWorksnl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WWWorksnl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WWWorksnl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WWWorksnl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WWWorksnl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-02-04T12:33:24Z","updated_at":"2018-03-02T14:07:56Z","closed_at":"2018-03-02T14:07:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Trying for weeks now.
