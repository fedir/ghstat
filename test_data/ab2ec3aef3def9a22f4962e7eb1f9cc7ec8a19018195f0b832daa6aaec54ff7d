In fact, they do not refer to any point._id stored in PouchDB.\r\n\r\nMy attempt at resolving this bug:\r\nhttps://github.com/josephmturner/ushin-db/tree/reassign_main","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8200","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8200/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8200/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8200/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8200","id":713547209,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MTM1NDcyMDk=","number":8200,"title":"PouchDB callbacks never invoked when indexDB has pending opens/deletes","user":{"login":"regnete","id":3276866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzY4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3276866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regnete","html_url":"https://github.com/regnete","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regnete/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regnete/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regnete/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regnete/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regnete/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regnete/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regnete/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regnete/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regnete/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2231680049,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjMxNjgwMDQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-10-02T11:21:45Z","updated_at":"2020-11-08T01:38:26Z","closed_at":"2020-11-08T01:38:26Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!--\r\n     Hello! 👋\r\n     Thank you for opening an issue on PouchDB.\r\n     There is also a 3-Minute read, on how to format your issue:\r\n     https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\r\n     This template is optional, but it may help us fix your issue faster.\r\n-->\r\n### Issue\r\nThe callbacks on any method of a local PouchDB instance are not invoked, when the underlying indexedDB has pending opens/deletes. This may e.g. happen due to a prior unsuccessfull attempt to destroy a db.\r\n\r\nsee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47758958/pouchdb-callbacks-never-invoked/64170453#64170453\r\n\r\n\r\n### Info\r\n- Environment: Browser\r\n- Platform: Chrome\r\n- Adapter: IndexedDB (deteced with old indexedDB adapter, may possibly also happen with new adapter )\r\n- Server: none\r\n### Reproduce\r\n\r\nFirst try somehow to get the indexDB in a state with pending opens/deletes > 0. This may be inspected by looking at chrome://indexeddb-internals/ in the chrome instance.\r\nThen execute this code:\r\n```js\r\nlet databaseToQuery = new PouchDB('some_db');\r\ndatabaseToQuery.info().then(\r\n  info => {\r\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(info));\r\n  }).catch((error) => {\r\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(error));\r\n  });\r\n```\r\nThe Promise gets neither resolved nor rejected.\r\n\r\n### Suggested Solution\r\nOne could implement a timeout observer when accessing the indexedDB for the first time. The observer should fire the error callback when indexedDB.open() doesn't respond within a certain amount of time (e.g. 10 seconds). This would help developers to find the root cause instead of debugging why the PouchDB promises get never resolved.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/packages/node_modules/pouchdb-adapter-idb/src/index.js#L647\r\n\r\nPseudo code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar timeout = setTimeout(function(){\r\n   timeout = null;\r\n callback('cannot open indexedDB ' + dbName + ' within 10 seconds. check if the db has pending opens/deletes (chrome://indexeddb-internals/).');\r\n}, 10000);\r\n\r\n```\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baggachipz/tinylist/issues/10","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baggachipz/tinylist","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baggachipz/tinylist/issues/10/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baggachipz/tinylist/issues/10/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baggachipz/tinylist/issues/10/events","html_url":"https://github.com/baggachipz/tinylist/issues/10","id":727664312,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3Mjc2NjQzMTI=","number":10,"title":"An item that is inserted in the middle of a checklist does not get saved","user":{"login":"w-k-s","id":3167727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc3Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3167727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-k-s","html_url":"https://github.com/w-k-s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-k-s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-k-s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-k-s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-k-s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-k-s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-k-s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-k-s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-k-s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-k-s/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-10-22T19:30:34Z","updated_at":"2020-10-22T20:22:22Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T20:22:21Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Steps:**\n1.

investigating the problems with Indexed DB described in #202 , I've noticed that Zone.js proxies seem to modify scope in a way that can cause problems depending on the implementation of event handling

https://github.com/angular/zone.js/blob/master/lib/patch/property-descriptor.js I was able to use Indexed DB with correctly established Zones. However, when using PouchDB which is a wrapper around Indexed DB (and other storage) the patch does not seem to work in a way that breaks PouchDB.\n\nPouchDB is using \"inline handlers\" (`request.onsuccess = function...`) that were covered using my monkey patch in https://github.com/angular/zone.js/blob/master/lib/patch/property-descriptor.js by using `utils.patchProperties(IDBRequest.prototype)` (and others). However, somehow the proxies seem to break PouchDB and I don't get the results.

The only way to get a target to count multiple reports per contact is to set its `idType` to `report`. This is not the scope of this issue, though. \r\nWhen there are multiple emissions for one contact for one target (multiple reports that match the `appliesIf` and `passesIf` for a single contact), the winning emission (whose reported_date will determine which reporting interval the \"contact\" gets counted towards the target goal) is not deterministic. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Create a simple target that counts reports, this is an example, but you can use any form you desire:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  id: 'target_forma',\r\n  translation_key: 'target',\r\n  subtitle_translation_key: 'target',\r\n  type: 'count',\r\n  icon: 'no-icon',\r\n  goal: 16,\r\n  appliesTo: 'reports',\r\n  appliesToType: ['forma'],\r\n  appliesIf: function () {\r\n    return true;\r\n  },\r\n  date: 'reported'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Create a bunch of reports that will match this target, all reports about the same patient. \r\nIt's helpful to generate these in a CSV and upload them with medic-conf because you're going to need to change their reported_date and _id fields. \r\n\r\nCreate reports in different reporting periods (different months) and make sure their _id fields are out of sort. When I tested, this was my report list:\r\n\r\n| _id | form | reported_date | \r\n| --- | ---- | ------------- |\r\n| a_report | forma | date in February | \r\n| b_report | forma | date in January | \r\n| c_report | forma | date in June | \r\n| d_report | forma | date in April | \r\n| e_report | forma | date in May | \r\n\r\nSo I'm making a very clear alphabetically sorted list of _id with a completely scrambled list of reported_dates. \r\n\r\n3. Login as an offline user that would sync all these reports. Go to the targets page. \r\nCheck if you get a count on your target.\r\n4. Change your OS clock to be in June (`c_report` is the \"latest\" of its type, so theoretically it should be the one to generate the winning emission). \r\nCheck your targets page and see that you don't have a target count. \r\n5. Change your OS clock to be in January (`a_report` is the \"first\" of it's type, so if the first chronological report is selected, this should be the one to generate the winning emission). \r\nCheck your targets page and see that you don't have a target count. \r\n6. Change your OS clock to Feb / April and see that you don't have a target count. \r\n7. Change your OS clock to May and see that you DO have a target count. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI believe, pre 3.8 the last chronological report was generating the winning emission. \r\nPre 3.8, we were using the Search service to get a list of reports:\r\nhttps://github.com/medic/cht-core/blob/3.7.x/webapp/src/js/services/rules-engine.js#L224\r\nRelevant part of the search service is here: https://github.com/medic/cht-core/blob/3.7.x/shared-libs/search/src/search.js#L33 where we sort the results by view value, which is the reported_date: https://github.com/medic/cht-core/blob/3.7.x/ddocs/medic-client/views/reports_by_validity/map.js#L3\r\n\r\nPost 3.8 we just query the `reports_by_subject` here https://github.com/medic/cht-core/blob/master/shared-libs/rules-engine/src/pouchdb-provider.js#L34 and never sort the results. \r\nCouchDB/PouchDB view queries will return rows sorted by the emitted key, and if the key is the same, sorted by _id. The emitted value - which is the reported_date in this case - is not taken into account. \r\nhttps://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/ddoc/views.html?highlight=view#api-ddoc-view-sorting\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n- Instance: any 3.8+\r\n- App: webapp\r\n- Version: 3.8+\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis was reported as a regression by a partner after an upgrade to 3.9.1. \r\nNot sure about labeling and whether we should consider this production-urgent or not.

Users create projects and edit them in a browser editor. The editor syncs the changes with the remote Cloudant database. I love this approach as I can easily copy/clone projects using replication and give multiple users access to a project using _security.\n\nBut the question is, how do I authenticate the browser against Cloudant? Two options\n1. Send plaintext user/password to the browser so it can send it to Cloudant via basic auth -> no way I'm going to do this.\n2. Create a Cloudant session on the server and send the Cookie to the browser -> doesn't work because I can't set a third party cookie for the CORS request.\n\nIn order for number 2 to work, I need to be able to send the `AuthSession` in a custom header which I can control in the xhr instance.\n\nNow that I think about it, this wouldn't work either. Because Cloudant doesn't use _users (is it fully supported if I enable it?). What I want to avoid is that my server side application has access to plaintext passwords. The only exception is during signup (in which case CouchDB would do the password hashing for me, Cloudant doesn't) and login (which would be the only place I'm able to request a session from Cloudant and my application would only pass the credentials over without doing anything with them).\n\nSo, how do I solve this? Even if I roll my own user management (which I don't want) and generate an API key per user, I still have two problems: I'd need to store the API key in plaintext/encrypted, because I need it in plaintext to get a session from Cloudant and additionally I sill can't send it as a CORS cookie.\n\nThe only option I currently see is rolling my own sessions by generating API keys and expiring them within my application logic (which would mean constantly updating the _security of the databases).\n\nEdit: of course there's at least one other option, which would be to proxy all db traffic through my backend (which has its own session management), but that's pointless as I want the DB to scale independent from my application. The PouchDB communication with Cloudant is like 99% of the traffic, the application server just glues everything together.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8097","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8097/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8097/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8097/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8097","id":642080537,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDIwODA1Mzc=","number":8097,"title":"[meta] Fix all the build things","user":{"login":"daleharvey","id":37787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/37787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daleharvey","html_url":"https://github.com/daleharvey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daleharvey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daleharvey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daleharvey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daleharvey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daleharvey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daleharvey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daleharvey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daleharvey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daleharvey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2231680049,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjMxNjgwMDQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pouchdb/pouchdb/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2020-06-19T16:10:14Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T05:31:55Z","closed_at":"2020-09-03T01:31:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hey all, long time :) so got an unspecified period of time I have some time to commit to pouchdb, now mostly I havent been contributing because I dont have time but I also find the current setup / build extremely confusing and intimidating.
