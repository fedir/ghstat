there,\r\n\r\nGood day and how are you? I hope this message finds you well.\r\n\r\nI am Joseph Buarao , who has been doing high quality Filipino and Tagalog translations for several projects.\r\n\r\nConsider this message as my letter of application. I am a web developer by profession and an experienced Filipino translator - these are on top of being an experienced web developer with more than 6 years of experience and specialized in the following scripting languages and technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, JQUERY, PHP, WORDPRESS and CONCRETE5). This means I know which codes are to be translated, and which ones that are to remain as it is. I am a strong advocate of thought-by-thought instead of word-by-word style of doing the translations, and I am carefully strict in grammars and spellings and proper word conjugations of my languages, Filipino and Tagalog.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you soon and work with you in the translations. You can count on me that I will do my job with utmost dedication. Thank you and more power to you.\r\n\r\nYou can check my previous contributions:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/textpattern/textpattern/commit/29308ff0d524e0b647ebb609710fdcb8acaee574\r\nhttps://crowdin.com/project/textpattern-cms-textpacks/fil\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nJoseph Buarao","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/434","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/434/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/434/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/434/events","html_url":"https://github.com/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/434","id":295269262,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTUyNjkyNjI=","number":434,"title":"It looks like the Autoloader.php path on Fuel_twig_parser.php is not correct","user":{"login":"watahell","id":13997960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTk3OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13997960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/watahell","html_url":"https://github.com/watahell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watahell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watahell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watahell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watahell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watahell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watahell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watahell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watahell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watahell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-02-07T19:48:29Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T20:42:12Z","closed_at":"2018-03-22T20:42:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi there\r\n\r\nI had a hard time making my new installation work.

The rest of the response is blank. The browser inspector shows that there is a 404 error while fetching the page `/admin/undefined/inline_edit/1`. The `undefined` is from the lack of a `data-module` attribute.\r\ndd\r\n![edit2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30811068/29222749-cedba232-7e91-11e7-86bc-3b7ea188f5af.png)\r\n\r\nSo it took a lot of digging through source code but I discovered the reason for the 404, and `undefined` in the URL path was because the file `application/config/MY_fuel_modules.php` was missing a module definition:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$config['modules']['campaign_toolkit_categories'] = array(\r\n\t'module_name' => 'Campaign Toolkit Categories'\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think when rendering the modal window it would be useful to display an error message when this happens. Best of course if it can specify the real problem (\"module name is undefined\" or something) but even a simple \"resource failed to load\" would be better than showing what looks like a block that may have failed to render or has bad CSS that sets the height very small.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this issue.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/415","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/415/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/415/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/415/events","html_url":"https://github.com/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/415","id":240411185,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNDA0MTExODU=","number":415,"title":"Latest version for codeigniter release.","user":{"login":"Jaironlanda","id":7873044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzMwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7873044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaironlanda","html_url":"https://github.com/Jaironlanda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaironlanda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaironlanda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaironlanda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaironlanda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaironlanda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaironlanda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaironlanda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaironlanda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaironlanda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-04T12:48:55Z","updated_at":"2017-07-09T12:15:57Z","closed_at":"2017-07-09T12:15:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-68279.html\r\n\r\nP/s: how to manual update/upgrade new version fuel cms","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/414","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/414/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/414/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/414/events","html_url":"https://github.com/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/414","id":240402639,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNDA0MDI2Mzk=","number":414,"title":"I'm unable to access my Fuel CMS account","user":{"login":"Diablo1066","id":25431894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDMxODk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25431894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diablo1066","html_url":"https://github.com/Diablo1066","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diablo1066/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diablo1066/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diablo1066/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diablo1066/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diablo1066/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diablo1066/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diablo1066/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diablo1066/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diablo1066/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-07-04T12:12:24Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T20:42:45Z","closed_at":"2018-03-22T20:42:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When trying to load the site I'm receiving numerous Errors and exceptions.
