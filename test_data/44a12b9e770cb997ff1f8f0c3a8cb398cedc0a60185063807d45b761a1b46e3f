In particular, some of the more critical technical upgrades have been made recently for Opencms.\r\nMainly these:\r\n1, for dependenciew.gradle in a very large number of dependent libraries made the most possible upgrade (to the latest version). . I think the new version of the thing may be in terms of performance and Bug will be improved.\r\n2, Solr, Lucene upgrade from 5.5 to 7.2. Background modified some of the relevant implementation code.\r\n3, using HikariCP as a database connection pool to achieve.\r\n4, the log system upgrade to Log4j2.\r\n5, there are some functional changes. For example, before the new data is created under .content \\ [datatype] \\ subFolder \\ subFolder, the default path is still .content \\ [datatype], which needs to be modified each time, so I made a change and can create new data in the subdirectory, And the current directory as the default storage path.\r\nOthers are not listed one by one.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade results how, in fact, I did not do a lot of tests to verify, but there is a clear data for reference.\r\nMay mainly upgrade the relationship between Solr (and Lucene) and the database connection pool, the official version, the new deployment of all Opencms Modules (system and Demo), it takes about 20 minutes, after the upgrade, this process takes only 4 minutes Or so, sometimes less than 4 minutes. And then run up the website everything is normal, there is nothing wrong. Search is normal.\r\n\r\nMy current site project, very complex, a variety of data has 100000 +, a variety of different pages have 100 + ,, After completing the above upgrade, my website project is up and running is normal.\r\n\r\nSo I think, for Opencms make changes / upgrades, is there any other people also need it, so I want to share with you.

Whenever we specify a new location, it is empty. So no preview is shown. When trying to edit it (folder-symbol) it shows the error message 'Missing Google Maps API Key...'. The problem is that we provided a valid key via the root folder properties. Debugging the method CmsLocationPickerWidget.getConfiguration() also confirmed that our provided key is used. The problems seems to be the missing map preview, since this is also one of the things that  is checked in method CmsLocationController.hasError().\r\n\r\n<img width=\"951\" alt=\"error message\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19167309/25118632/68a96cb2-2417-11e7-8f17-51981f2c328f.png\">\r\n\r\nWe tried a workaround (editing the control code manually and inserting the xml-formatted location-code from some 'old' component) and voila - the map preview is shown and also the folder-button to edit the location works.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1250\" alt=\"manually providing location\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19167309/25118646/76eea454-2417-11e7-8f1b-defdce7cff6b.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1075\" alt=\"working location picker\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19167309/25118647/76efccc6-2417-11e7-96aa-6175be0d4187.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarks/Questions:\r\n1. How do I debug the code of packages org.opencms.gwt.client and beyond? Unfortunatly the 'normal' debugging doesn't work here. At least it doesn't stop at the specified breakpoints in class CmsLocationController. For org.opencms.widgets.CmsLocationPickerWidget debugging works...\r\n2.
