support for setter injection via generic \"setProperty()\" method.\n* FLOW3: (Component) Setter injection is now also possible via a \"inject\" method, e.g. injectSomeDependency() (instead of setSomeDependency). All methods whose name starts with \"inject\" will be included into the autowiring procedure. Therefore dependencies don't need to be configured explicitly in the Components.ini when \"inject\" methods are used. Resolves #319.\n* FLOW3: (Component) Added autowiring support for \"inject\" setter methods. Addresses #319.\n* Smarty: Added check against multiple definition of \"SMARTY_DIR\"\n* Testing, TYPO3, PhoneBookTutorial: Refactored to the new \"inject*\" methods in the action

isSame to be closer to the specification, effectively fixing a bug\n * (Item) Fixed missing exception on getAncestor() for root node\n * (Node) Fixed a bug where adding a node would cause existing subnodes to be ignored\n * (Session) save() is now dead until freshly implemented\n * (StorageAccess_PDO) getRawRootNode() now has code\nTests:\n * Renamed, reorganized and fixed a lot of code, documentation and whitespace\n * Tests use mock objects for storage, session, repository where possible (speedup!)\n * BaseTest class is gone now\n * StorageAccessTest has been split into a base class and a PDO-specific test for now\n * (TYPO3CR.db) The sqlite database is copied from the fixtures folder for the actual test, thus it is not changed anymore during the tests.\n * (TYPO3CR.db) The database is now empty except for the table structure, as all tests needing data use mock objects.\nOriginal-Commit-Hash:
