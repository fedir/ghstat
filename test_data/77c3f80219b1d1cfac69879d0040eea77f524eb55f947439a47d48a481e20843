Although one could argue that this is not what a plugin is for, it is nonetheless a regression from the old system. It is also very useful to be able to do so: imagine that you have a \"normal\" module that exports a bunch of functions, and you want a Dancer plugin variant (as is the case with LogReport). It's much nicer being able to load a plugin and get all the normal module functionality plus some special Dancer things, rather than to have to load both the core module plus the plugin.\n\nLike I say, I'll pass more details when I get a chance, I just wanted to give an initial heads-up.
