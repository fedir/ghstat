I just tried to use `@cached()` decorator, as described in [docs](http://turbogears.readthedocs.org/en/latest/turbogears/caching.html?highlight=cache#controller-caching).\nUnfortunately, it seems to be not working - it correctly stores the first value into cache, but subsequent calls return the cached version even when URL arguments change. I observed this behaviour only on `_default()` method. Here are steps to reproduce:\n\n``` python\nimport logging\nfrom wsgiref.simple_server import make_server\nfrom tg import expose, TGController, AppConfig, cached\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n\nclass RootController(TGController):\n    @cached(expire=100)\n    @expose()\n    def index(self, **kw):\n        return dict(status='works', **kw)\n\n    @cached(expire=100)\n    @expose()\n    def _default(self, id):\n        return dict(status='fails', id=id)\n\n\nconfig = AppConfig(minimal=True, root_controller=RootController())\nconfig['cache.enabled'] = True\nconfig['default_renderer'] = 'json'\n\nmake_server('', 8080, config.make_wsgi_app()).serve_forever()\n```\n\nLet's try some tests:\n\n```\n# 1st index get, data stored to cache\n$ curl http://localhost:8080/?id=1\n{\"status\": \"works\", \"id\": \"1\"}\n# 2nd index get with another parameter, data stored to cache\n$ curl http://localhost:8080/?id=2\n{\"status\": \"works\", \"id\": \"2\"}\n# 1st get on _default, for id=3\n$ curl http://localhost:8080/3\n{\"status\": \"fails\", \"id\": \"3\"}\n# 2nd get on _default with id=4, incorrectly returns cached value id=3\n$ curl http://localhost:8080/4\n{\"status\": \"fails\", \"id\": \"3\"}\n```\n\nI was not able to make `@cached` work using argument `key`. It looks like cache key generating function is somehow broken.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TurboGears/tg2/issues/65","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TurboGears/tg2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TurboGears/tg2/issues/65/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TurboGears/tg2/issues/65/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TurboGears/tg2/issues/65/events","html_url":"https://github.com/TurboGears/tg2/issues/65","id":95360219,"number":65,"title":"Program
