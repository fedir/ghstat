issue is very similar to #1697, but I'm not able to make it work using proposed solution.\r\nMy plugin is simple axios proxy:\r\n```\r\nimport axios from \"axios/index\";\r\n\r\nlet instance = axios.create({\r\n  baseURL: process.env.API_URL,\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction getHeader(token) {\r\n  return {\r\n    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ({ store },

@include font-prompt;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it failed to compile unless I specify the extension of the scss file like `@import '@/styles/coride/custom-mixins.scss'`\r\n\r\nBecause I am converting a VueJS application to NuxtJS, in the VueJS application, I don't need to specify the extension. So it will be quite tedious to convert all those files.\r\nIt will be great if I can do the same with VueJS in NuxtJS.\n\n<!--cmty--><!--cmty_prevent_hook-->\n<div align=\"right\"><sub><em>This question is available on <a href=\"https://nuxtjs.cmty.io\">Nuxt.js</a> community (<a href=\"https://nuxtjs.cmty.io/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/c7013\">#c7013</a>)</em></sub></div>","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/3292","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/3292/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/3292/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/3292/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/3292","id":319820334,"number":3292,"title":"How to hide xhr finished loading after get data axios?","user":{"login":"phucvo0709","id":35060381,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/35060381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phucvo0709","html_url":"https://github.com/phucvo0709","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phucvo0709/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phucvo0709/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phucvo0709/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phucvo0709/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phucvo0709/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phucvo0709/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phucvo0709/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phucvo0709/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phucvo0709/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":882702353,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js/labels/cmty:question","name":"cmty:question","color":"5af1ca","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-05-03T07:57:41Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T08:04:42Z","closed_at":"2018-05-03T07:57:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"How to hide xhr finished loading console log after get data by axios, for another people cannot find my api!\r\n\r\n![untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35060381/39565450-2a84b99a-4ee2-11e8-99a0-2fe9c038f2e1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--cmty--><!--cmty_prevent_hook-->\r\n<div align=\"right\"><sub><em>This question is available on <a href=\"https://nuxtjs.cmty.io\">Nuxt.js</a> community (<a href=\"https://nuxtjs.cmty.io/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/c7011\">#c7011</a>)</em></sub></div>","score":1.0}]}
