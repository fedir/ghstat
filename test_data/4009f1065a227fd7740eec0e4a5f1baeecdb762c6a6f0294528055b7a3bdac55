This achieves pretty amazing transfer speeds (hard to say, because of the small data sets I'm playing with but, saw it spike to 20 Mbps before the data finishes).\r\n\r\nAlso fixed a bunch of bugs. Some in Badger related to key moves and nil txn.callbacks. And an assert failure in watermark.go.\r\n\r\nThis should also fix the crash in #2424 ."}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dgraph-io/dgraph/commits/009b18f2266efc8d0045b1776a7c15c633c14ecb","html_url":"https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/commit/009b18f2266efc8d0045b1776a7c15c633c14ecb","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dgraph-io/dgraph/commits/009b18f2266efc8d0045b1776a7c15c633c14ecb/comments","author":{"login":"manishrjain","id":1782324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODIzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1782324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishrjain","html_url":"https://github.com/manishrjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishrjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishrjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishrjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishrjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishrjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishrjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishrjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishrjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishrjain/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"78f457e4fd7d6c91ca3e4288d535fee1cb25ddda","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dgraph-io/dgraph/commits/78f457e4fd7d6c91ca3e4288d535fee1cb25ddda","html_url":"https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/commit/78f457e4fd7d6c91ca3e4288d535fee1cb25ddda"}]},{"sha":"78f457e4fd7d6c91ca3e4288d535fee1cb25ddda","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDEzNDkwMzk6NzhmNDU3ZTRmZDdkNmM5MWNhM2U0Mjg4ZDUzNWZlZTFjYjI1ZGRkYQ==","commit":{"author":{"name":"Manish R Jain","email":"manish@dgraph.io","date":"2018-06-13T02:22:48Z"},"committe
