I specifically say Apache-style logs because there are a lot of great tools that exist out there for parsing and dealing with logs that follow this particular format, so I'd really like the format of the logs to match an actual Apache log as closely as possible. I recently switched a big project from Webmachine over to Cowboy, and overall I've really loved Cowboy, but the one thing I've missed from Webmachine is the Apache-style logging features that it has. If we could get that added, Cowboy would really be perfect for my needs 😀\r\n\r\nI can see this has been discussed before for pre-2.0 Cowboy, and it looks like the `onresponse` hook would work great, but it looks like that feature has been removed in 2.0 and later. I also looked into creating a middleware module for this, but it doesn't seem like you can get all the info you need to include stuff like the response code, since sending a response seems to follow a totally separate code path that doesn't involve the middleware stuff at all.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to submit a patch to Cowboy to help enable this, but I'm not sure what the best way to go about it would be from an architectural standpoint. Some sort of enhancement to middlewares? Bringing onresponse back? Maybe building better logging features directly into Cowboy as a first-class feature? Or something else entirely? I figured I'd better have a discussion about this before I start coding, to make sure whatever I implement has a shot at being accepted.

is a bit of a very unusual issue for myself. I don't know if I have something setup wrong, or if there is black magic in the works, or I drank too many fizzy drinks to read the docs slow enough, but I'll do my best to describe my issue...\r\n\r\nSo I have gulp converting my pug.js input into a friendly browser readable .html file. Whenever I make any changes to the pug.js file for gulp to update the .html file in my priv folder it updates perfectly fine. No issue here. However, when I attempt to see my changes on the server using Cowboy, I don't see my changes reflect.\r\n\r\nHere's what I've done, running `rebar3 shell`\r\n\r\n- Attempt to Google my issue. I haven't seen anyone run into this, and I am using the most recent version. So perhaps this is a new bug, and I'm the only one thus far who has ran into it?\r\n- Delete the priv folder of my app's output _build. -- No dice\r\n- Blow away browser cache. -- Nothing\r\n- Directly input my priv folder path using this `{\"/assets/[...]\", cowboy_static, {dir, code:priv_dir(bombinaid) ++ \"/assets\"}}`. -- Nope.avi\r\n- Directly edit the HTML file inside the priv folder. -- Negative!\r\n- Also I notice if I remove all the text inside the html file parts of the old file still appear. So for some reason Cowboy registers the removed/added text, but still shows old files or garbage data.\r\n- Blow away _build folder all together. IT WORKS!

If its not, should I use an external tools like Nginx/HAProxy for redirecting?\r\n\r\nI have also tried running both http and https by calling both start_clear and start_tls, but it seems only one survives?

I did a bit more digging and compared how the following request's headers are parsed by `1.1.2` and `2.0`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost:8080/ -d 'foo bar baz'\r\n```\r\n\r\nCowboy `1.1.2` \r\n\r\n```\r\n{<<\"content-type\">>,<<\"application/json;charset=UTF-8\">>},\r\n{<<\"content-type\">>,<<\"application/json\">>},\r\n```\r\n\r\nCowboy `2.0.0`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<<\"content-type\">> =>\r\n    <<\"application/json;charset=UTF-8, application/json\">>,\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis explains why the upgrade to `2.0.0` resulted in the `415` error as `content_types_accepted` didn't match the `<<\"application/json;charset=UTF-8, application/json\">>` binary passed to it.\r\n\r\nIn the case of `Content-Type`, I don't believe multiple headers should be combined this way. The [BNF for Content-Type](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1341) doesn't make any mention of multiple values allowed, and [this document](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2)
