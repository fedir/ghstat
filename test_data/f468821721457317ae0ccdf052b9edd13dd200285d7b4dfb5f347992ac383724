Unfortunately, after the aforementioned commit, $c->state() is not set to 0. The line(s) setting $c->state to 0 are commented out in that commit along with the message \"preserve $c->state\".\n\nThe unfortunate effect of this is that if we throw an exception inside our authenticate action, it is now short circuiting and allowing control flow to continue, despite our exception.\n\nFor now, we resolved the issue by returning if $c->has_errors but it seems that this commit should either be reverted, or the documentation updated to reflect the fact that checking the $c->forward() return value is no longer a reliable way to handle exceptions.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime/issues/132","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime/issues/132/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime/issues/132/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime/issues/132/events","html_url":"https://github.com/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime/issues/132","id":138637896,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMzg2Mzc4OTY=","number":132,"title":"Default charset disappeared in MetaCPAN (cpan-api) after upgrade from 5.90053 to 5.90103 ","user":{"login":"oalders","id":96205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/96205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oalders","html_url":"https://github.com/oalders","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oalders/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oalders/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oalders/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oalders/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oalders/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oalders/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oalders/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oalders/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oalders/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-03-05T03:13:46Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T03:46:12Z","closed_at":"2016-03-08T03:46:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm gearing up for the QA Hackathon and I'm just trying to upgrade the API side of MetaCPAN to the latest Catalyst, but I've got some failing tests which show:\n\n```\n        #   Failed test 'Content-type'\n        #   at t/server/controller/source.t line 79.\n        #          got: 'text/plain'\n        #     expected: 'text/plain; charset=UTF-8'\n        ok 8 - Change-log content\n```\n\nBuild is at https://travis-ci.org/CPAN-API/cpan-api/jobs/113828722#L3061\n\nI'm wondering what happened to the charset.  @shadowcat-mst suggested I open an issue here to see if anyone could help.\n\nThanks very much!\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime/issues/113","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime/issues/113/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime/issues/113/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime/issues/113/events","html_url":"https://github.com/perl-catalyst/catalyst-runtime/issues/113","id":100774092,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMDA3NzQwOTI=","number":113,"title":"What to do when trying to lookup a $component that does ACCEPT_CONTEXT in $app scope","user":{"login":"jjn1056","id":67652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/67652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjn1056","html_url":"https://github.com/jjn1056","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjn1056/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjn1056/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjn1056/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjn1056/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjn1056/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjn1056/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjn1056/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjn1056/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjn1056/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-08-13T13:51:26Z","updated_at":"2015-10-29T15:19:15Z","closed_at":"2015-10-29T15:19:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"AFAIK we never well defined what Myapp->component (->model, ->controller, ->view) should do.
