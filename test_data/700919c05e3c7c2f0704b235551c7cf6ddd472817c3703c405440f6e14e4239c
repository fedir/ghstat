I am using the jacman theme. it uses the `css` method with  `css('css/style')`. the return value of that method that ends up in the pages is \r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/style.css\">\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/%02.css\">\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/.css\">\r\n``` \r\nThe problem has something todo with the `flatten` method. it is using `for(const i in arr){...}`. When I change this loop to `arr.forEach(...)` it behaves right. \r\nusing console.log I did some debugging. flatten takes the single array from args and there are 3 properties. `0`, `S`, and `in_array`. I don't know what `S` is, but I did '.toString()', for the in_array method, there is this code: \r\n```js\r\nfunction(e){\r\n                        var r=new RegExp(this.S+e+this.S);\r\n                        return (r.test(this.S+this.join(this.S)+this.S));\r\n                                }\r\n```\r\nI was searching for the this.S and the in_array method, but could not really find it in my `node_modues` directory. I somehow think it is coming from the `nunjucks` dependency, but can't say for sure. nunjucks is used by multiple hexo-... modules.\r\n\r\nWhen I change the implementation of `flatten` to use `arr.forEach(...)` instead of the `for-in` loop it works good. \r\n\r\nWould you accept a PR to change the implementation of flatten to forEach?\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo-migrator-wordpress/issues/102","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo-migrator-wordpress","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo-migrator-wordpress/issues/102/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo-migrator-wordpress/issues/102/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo-migrator-wordpress/issues/102/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-migrator-wordpress/issues/102","id":688648683,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODg2NDg2ODM=","number":102,"title":"Migrated images pointing on wp-content on Wordpress blog","user":{"login":"jashsayani","id":18684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/18684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jashsayani","html_url":"https://github.com/jashsayani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jashsayani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jashsayani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jashsayani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jashsayani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jashsayani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jashsayani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jashsayani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jashsayani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jashsayani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-08-30T04:04:47Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T04:39:05Z","closed_at":"2020-08-30T04:39:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Some posts using the URL from `wp-content` and pointing to hosted Wordpress blog\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-08-29 at 9 03 18 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18684/91650944-171d7d00-ea3b-11ea-9814-b74aa8f2d6ba.png)\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo/issues/4486","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo/issues/4486/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo/issues/4486/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo/issues/4486/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues/4486","id":683062895,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODMwNjI4OTU=","number":4486,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of null","user":{"login":"KumaNNN","id":31473722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDczNzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/31473722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KumaNNN","html_url":"https://github.com/KumaNNN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KumaNNN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KumaNNN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KumaNNN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KumaNNN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KumaNNN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KumaNNN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KumaNNN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KumaNNN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KumaNNN/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":329928470,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMjk5Mjg0NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hexojs/hexo/labels/theme","name":"theme","color":"800080","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-08-20T20:06:02Z","updated_at":"2020-10-17T18:46:23Z","closed_at":"2020-08-21T02:08:39Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!-- NOTE:\r\n\r\n针对简体中文用户的提示：在提交 issue 时请不要删除下面的模板，按照步骤提供相关信息将有助于我们调查你的问题。请尽量使用英语描述你的问题，这可以让更多的人帮助到你。\r\n\r\nIf you find that markdown files are not rendered as expected, please go to https://marked.js.org/demo/ to see if it can be reproduced there.

only change math settings:\r\n\r\nthe test blog I write：\r\n```\r\n---\r\ntitle: equation\r\ndate: 2020-09-21 10:46:54\r\ntags:\r\n---\r\n\r\ninline equation：$x^2$\r\nmultiline
