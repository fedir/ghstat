For example, I need to migrate my local Directus DB to a remote server, other than replacing the entire MySql DB, is there any other way that I can only migrate the changed schema? Can I log/capture all MySQL queries that have been done through Directus(like delta changes)? \r\n\r\nBesides, if I have two instances with Directus installed but I wish to share a common File System remotely from another instance, is it achievable? I find that Directus supports FTP filesystem adapters but no further explanation is given. https://docs.getdirectus.com/6.4.0/#Storage_Adapters\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n 1. \r\n 2. \r\n 3. \r\n\r\n## Schema Dump, Logs, or Screenshots","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus/issues/2115","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus/issues/2115/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus/issues/2115/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus/issues/2115/events","html_url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2115","id":310299926,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTAyOTk5MjY=","number":2115,"title":"Make step size for range fields change database type, or allow it to be set upon creation and not changed","user":{"login":"ninemind","id":4838451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Mzg0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4838451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninemind","html_url":"https://github.com/ninemind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninemind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninemind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninemind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninemind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninemind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninemind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninemind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninemind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninemind/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-04-01T06:08:29Z","updated_at":"2018-04-01T07:39:22Z","closed_at":"2018-04-01T07:39:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## Version Info\r\n  - Directus version: 6.4.8\r\n  - PHP version: 7.1\r\n  - MySQL version: 10.2.13-MariaDB-10.2.13+maria~jessie\r\n  - Web server: nginx 1.10.3\r\n  - OS name and version: Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nWhen setting step size for range fields, make database field proper type.
