That is: to save the cropped images and to make them available throught API. \r\n\r\nAnd there is a question: How can I do that?\r\n\r\nI've tried to save/upload cropped images in similar way as in Single File Interface(this.fileModel.setFile(...)), but it didn't work, as I expected :(. Is there any trigger-kind-thing which upload file to the server? Or maybe I'm missing something and there is very easy way to that? I think it is important to point out that I intend to upload many images at once/per item in table.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus/issues/2091","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus/issues/2091/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus/issues/2091/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus/issues/2091/events","html_url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2091","id":302161154,"number":2091,"title":"mysql error trying to reset the password using cli","user":{"login":"rajiteh","id":905419,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/905419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajiteh","html_url":"https://github.com/rajiteh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajiteh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajiteh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajiteh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajiteh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajiteh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajiteh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajiteh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajiteh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajiteh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":49847316,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus/labels/4.%20Minor","name":"4.
