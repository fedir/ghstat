there. I'm new to Volt, I'm working through the Todo List tutorial in the docs, so I might have missed something obvious.\n- Open http://localhost:3000\n- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/todos to test the Todo features as they get added\n- Change a file as instructed in the documentations\n- The page is automatically reloaded but it just shows the error \"File not found: /todos\".\n- To see the changes I have to go back to http://localhost:3000/ and then navigate to http://localhost:3000/todos from the menu.\n\nHave I missed something, or is this something that is still being worked on?
