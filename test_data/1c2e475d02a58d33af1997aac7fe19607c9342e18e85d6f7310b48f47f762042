(Any time something mentions init.d, I know I'm in for a headache). Am I using upstart? I have no idea. I _do_ have an /etc/init.d/thin file. This is presumably what this web page means. However, what \"simply referenced\" means is another matter. Am I supposed to add the line to that file, and if so, at what point? Or is it a replacement? \n\n\" 'my_app' is the alias name\" \n\nWhich I take to mean whatever I used as the third parameter to the 'rvm alias . . .' command.

Almost.\n\nAs someone who is desperately looking for a lightweight alternative to Rails, I first turned to Sinatra. Very capable little framework with a huge community. There was just one problem - I can't stand the controllers and all those route blocks. I wanted a controller that was more OO, more Rubyish in the purest sense. This is where Magnus struck a chord with me.\n\nHe went on to gush about Camping's small and devoted community:\n\n```\nCamping definitely has a great community too. Size doesn't always matter. Because there are so few users, it means every single issue gets full attention.\n```\n\nThis is where he started to lose me. For starters you guys have open issues here from two years ago - many of them trailing off with unanswered questions. Secondly, yall are using the shittiest mailing list in the history of software. I mean seriously.. rubyforge mailman? Are we in the 21st century yet? I can't browse the archives without wanting to rip my eyeballs out with rusty pliers. Even google groups are a step up (and that's saying a lot).\n\nAnother huge weakness is public relations. It's great that Camping is trying to be different and goes against the grain of the mainstream. But I think this idea has been taken too far. There simply is not enough press or engagement to really expand its sphere of influence in a meaningful way. No announcements of major updates. No blog posts. Either you're in the know, or.. fuck you. It's bad enough the name of the framework is common and hard to google, but this bad bit of SEO is exacerbated by a prevailing recluse mentality.\n\nAnd it's a damn shame because this is a great little framework! With very few exceptions (exception handling being one of them) it got so many things right. I suppose that is why I'm even bothering to write this issue. Maybe it will light a fire under someone's ass to remedy the situation. Given the track record, I am not betting the farm on it though.\n\nI do wish you guys the best of luck with this project, and hope that it will someday get the attention it deserves.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/macournoyer/thin/issues/119","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/macournoyer/thin","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/macournoyer/thin/issues/119/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/macournoyer/thin/issues/119/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/macournoyer/thin/issues/119/events","html_url":"https://github.com/macournoyer/thin/issues/119","id":5571475,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NTcxNDc1","number":119,"title":"Werror format-security during compilation on Ubuntu","user":{"login":"darioghilardi","id":88351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/88351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darioghilardi","html_url":"https://github.com/darioghilardi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darioghilardi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darioghilardi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darioghilardi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darioghilardi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darioghilardi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darioghilardi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darioghilardi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darioghilardi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darioghilardi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2012-07-12T13:25:16Z","updated_at":"2014-06-25T16:07:42Z","closed_at":"2012-08-07T13:54:53Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hello,\nI get the following error while compiling on Ubuntu.\n\n```\nerror: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Werror=format-security]\n```\n\nAny help?

It would run the first time I loaded the page after starting the server, but any subsequent page reloads would fail to re-run the before_all block.  Since I use the before_all block to load in a user's details based on their session, and redirect them to a login page if they don't have an active session, this is a pretty major problem for me.\n\nAfter a bit of digging, for a minimalist example (since I was using a bunch of stuff, including jquery mobile, ldap authentication, sequel with 2 databases, etc), I found that the exact scenario where it failed involved having a layout template for the action.  An action without a layout would run the before_all block fine, but one with a layout would only run the before_all block the first time it's called after the server is started.\n\nAnyway, here's a controller & layout to demonstrate the issue.  If you run this, and open /index, you will have before_all execute only the first time.  Opening /test will get before_all to run every time.\n\n``` ruby\n# controller.rb\nrequire 'ramaze'\n\nclass MainController < Ramaze::Controller\n    helper :aspect\n    helper :xhtml\n    engine :etanni\n    set_layout :default => [:index]\n\n    map '/'\n\n    before_all do\n        puts \"before-all\"\n        true\n    end\n\n    def initialize\n        puts 'MainController#initialize'\n    end\n\n    def index\n        puts 'MainController#index'\n        \"Hi<br><a href='test'>test</a>\"\n    end\n\n    def test\n        puts 'MainController#test'\n        \"Hi<br><a href='index'>index</a>\"\n    end\nend\n\nRamaze.start\n```\n\nAnd the layout file: layout/default.xhtml\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n\n    <title>Test before_all issue</title>\n  </head>\n<body>\n  #{@content}\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nI poked around in Innate a bit.  I couldn't make sense of why it appeared to be flagging my action with a layout as \"is_layout\", but I could make sense of where it attempted to pull data from a cache in node.rb.  So, I undid the change on line 283 (now 288) from last year:\nhttps://github.com/Ramaze/innate/commit/14ff7efb44d4f05f59dc226e69e26428dc8a8e79#diff-3\n\nSo, putting it back to:\n\n``` ruby\naction = resolve(path)\n```\n\ncauses my symptoms to go away.  So this is a fine workaround for me for the moment.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/59","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/59/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/59/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/59/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/59","id":9988126,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5OTg4MTI2","number":59,"title":"render_full mutates","user":{"login":"manveru","id":3507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manveru","html_url":"https://github.com/manveru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manveru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manveru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manveru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manveru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manveru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manveru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manveru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manveru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manveru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-01-15T17:55:57Z","updated_at":"2013-01-29T21:58:35Z","closed_at":"2013-01-29T21:58:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"```\n11:25   ramaze_user | render_full method uses Mock to render the request, which in turn invokes Current.new.
