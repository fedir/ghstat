My conf looks like that\r\n```\r\nsingle_binary=yes\r\nkore_source=/home/my/c/kore\r\nkore_flavor=DEBUG=1\r\n```\r\n2. Build like that\r\n```\r\nkodev build\r\n```\r\n3. Run like that\r\n```\r\ngdb --args ./mysite -dnrf\r\n```\r\n4. I have my gdb running, now I make breakpoints at function named **page**\r\n```\r\n>>> b page\r\n```\r\n5. Gdb sees my function because I get \r\n**Breakpoint 1 at 0x407ce0: file src/mysite.c, line 13.**\r\n6. Then I run kore inside gdb\r\n```\r\n>>> run\r\n```\r\n7.
