lifecycle methods are not @Autowired\n\nPrior to this commit, a developer may have accidentally annotated a\nJUnit Jupiter test method or lifecycle method with @Autowired, and that\nwould have potentially resulted in an exception that was hard to\nunderstand. This is because the Spring container considers any\n@Autowired method to be a \"configuration method\" when autowiring the\ntest class instance. Consequently, such an @Autowired method would be\ninvoked twice: once by Spring while attempting to autowire the test\ninstance and another time by JUnit Jupiter when invoking the test or\nlifecycle method. The autowiring invocation of the method often leads\nto an exception, either because Spring cannot satisfy a dependency (such\nas JUnit Jupiter's TestInfo) or because the body of the method fails due\nto test setup that has not yet been invoked.\n\nThis commit introduces validation for @Autowired test and lifecycle\nmethods in the SpringExtension that will throw an IllegalStateException\nif any @Autowired method in a test class is also annotated with any of\nthe following JUnit Jupiter annotations.\n\n- @Test\n- @TestFactory\n- @TestTemplate\n- @RepeatedTest\n- @ParameterizedTest\n-
