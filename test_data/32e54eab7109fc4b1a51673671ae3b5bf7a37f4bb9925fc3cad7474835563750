inifinite recursion in UndertowServerHttpResponse\n\nUndertow does not provide a way to check if we can write so with the\ncurrent implementation of isWritePossible, deep recursion can occur\nwhen writing slows down. We now use a flag to keep track of write\nChannelListener callbacks.\n\nThis commit also addresses a related issue in\nAbstractListenerWriteProcessor that went undected since #3c2d186\nwhere after a large (single) buffer that is not written fully, the\ncompletion signal is processed before the all data is written.\n\nIssue:
