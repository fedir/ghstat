This\r\nmatters, even if it's really old like version 0.1.0. Do note that bugs in older\r\nversions are commonly fixed in newer versions, so you should try to test it\r\nagainst the latest version if you can.\r\n-->\r\n**Mithril version:** 2.0.4\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nProvide the name and version of both the browser and operating system you're\r\nexperiencing these issues with. If it's multiple, feel free to list multiple.\r\nThis matters, even if it's super ancient like IE 6 on Windows XP.\r\n-->\r\n**Browser and OS:** Microsoft Edge (Chromium) 81.0.416.58 and Windows 10 Pro v1909 Build 18363.778\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOptional: Provide a link to your project, if it happens to be open source or if\r\nyou created a repo somewhere that we can look into further.

What code is causing the unexpected behavior? Make sure to\r\ntry to reduce your code as best as you can while still reproducing the bug, so\r\nwe can more accurately determine the cause. Ideally, it should just be a bunch\r\nof Mithril calls with virtually no logic at all, but it's sufficient to just\r\nremove unrelated network calls, attributes, and the like.\r\n\r\nIn addition, make sure the bug still persists with the latest version of\r\nMithril. If it's an older version, the bug may have already been fixed.\r\n\r\nIf you'd prefer, replace this code block with a link to a code playground like\r\nany of these:\r\n\r\n- Flems <https://flems.io/mithril> (stores everything in URL hash)\r\n- JSFiddle <https://jsfiddle.net>\r\n- CodePen <https://codepen.io>\r\n- JSBin <https://jsbin.com>\r\n- Plunker <https://plnkr.co>\r\n- Glitch <https://glitch.com> (supports backend)\r\n- CodeSandbox <https://codesandbox.io> (supports backend)\r\n\r\nOr if it's a remote development project on your own server, feel free to provide\r\nthat if it's serving unminified code we can look at.\r\n\r\nIf it's a closed-source repo, it's okay to censor names and pull out irrelevant\r\nlogic - we'd rather not sign NDAs just to see the code you're having trouble\r\nwith. We do still need code of some kind that triggers the bug you're running\r\ninto.\r\n-->\r\nMithril docs generation issue.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nWhat steps need to be taken to reproduce this behavior?

The easiest solution is to not use the backtick around the dollar sign to avoid the special replace pattern.  Another option is to switch to using a replacer function which doesn't have this same behavior (as stated at MDN link from above).  If the package.json reference hadn't also used backticks then I would have just removed them or switched it to single quotes.  Let me know what you'd like and I'd be happy to submit a PR.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/ospec/issues/14","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/ospec","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/ospec/issues/14/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/ospec/issues/14/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/ospec/issues/14/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MithrilJS/ospec/issues/14","id":564721325,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NjQ3MjEzMjU=","number":14,"title":"the

Plus, having a core utility that contradicts [this](https://mithril.js.org/components.html#don't-forward-vnodeattrs-itself-to-other-vnodes) doesn't really make sense, and I don't expect everyone to read the docs closely enough to pick this up. So instead, we should just provide a built-in utility to strip all that crap out *for* people.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n<!--\r\nWhy is this important to you? How would you use it? We need to know what\r\nproblems it would solve in the real world and what benefits it would bring, for\r\nboth you and other potential users, so we know how we should prioritize it and\r\nso we can see if a better solution might exist.\r\n-->\r\nWell, if you want to know how easy it is to get bit without realizing it, take a look at #2471.\r\n\r\n### Possible Implementation\r\n<!--\r\nOptional: How might this be implemented? This is optional, but it helps us put\r\nthe size and cost of the feature into perspective. Simpler features to implement\r\ncan often be justified by just being helpful, but big, complex features could\r\nrequire a massive benefit to pay for their size, scale, and complexity.\r\n\r\n(This is why the discussion on a context API similar to React's got so\r\ncontentious - it's right on that line where it could go either way on the\r\ncost/benefit ratio for us.)\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/isiahmeadows/mithril-helpers/blob/master/censor.js with the alterations needed to fuse into core. (It's 324 bytes min+gzip standalone.)\r\n\r\n### Open Questions\r\n<!--\r\nOptional: What things still need discussed? If there are certain details you\r\naren't sure about, this could help inform discussion. Open questions like these\r\nare precisely what shaped our sync vs async redraw API to be what they are for\r\nv2.\r\n-->\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/2527","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/mithril.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/2527/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/2527/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/2527/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/2527","id":490422280,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTA0MjIyODA=","number":2527,"title":"null/false are considered a vnode without a key","user":{"login":"mvndaai","id":326845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjg0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/326845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvndaai","html_url":"https://github.com/mvndaai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvndaai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvndaai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvndaai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvndaai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvndaai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvndaai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvndaai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvndaai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvndaai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":561167203,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NjExNjcyMDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/mithril.js/labels/Type:%20Gotcha","name":"Type: Gotcha","color":"ffcc00","default":false,"description":"For unwanted behavior that is still correct under the given circumstances"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"isiahmeadows","id":4483844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODM4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4483844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows","html_url":"https://github.com/isiahmeadows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"isiahmeadows","id":4483844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODM4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4483844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows","html_url":"https://github.com/isiahmeadows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isiahmeadows/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2019-09-06T16:45:02Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T23:08:02Z","closed_at":"2019-09-06T17:52:35Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!-- Provide a general summary of your issue in the \"Title\" above -->\r\n<!--\r\nProvide the exact version of Mithril you're experiencing these issues with.

mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_%28computer_graphics%29) API` renders just fine on GitHub (https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/blob/next/docs/vnodes.md), so it seems the parenthesis is somehow \"leaking\" during the static site generation process.\r\nI figure the authors of this repo are a lot more familiar with their docs' build process, so I'm not doing to dig deep

The behavior is correct in Firefox but not in Chrome.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nSeemingly at random, svg elements that remain between redraws suddenly disappear. Upon page refresh (with state saved in history.state), the elements reappear, but subsequent redraws trigger the bug again.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nYou might need to familiarize yourself with the provided code below in order to understand the following.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/1297 likely provides a workaround, however because the svgs are not held in a separate document, they are not able to be cached. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I'm not certain that referencing a javascript object, say, 50 times in a page (ex. icons), is comparable in performance to referencing the same element by ID with `use` 50 times.\r\n\r\nIf these two problems could be addressed, that would make encoding the svgs as mithril components viable, however it is still more complicated to set up a build pipeline. Currently I have a script that watches a folder for changes and automatically creates a minified document containing each `svg` icon as a symbol. Reworking this to output a valid mithril component that displays the correct `svg` based on a provided argument, or a page with several individual components, is very convoluted and could also hurt my build times.\r\n\r\nI have narrowed down the source of the problem a good bit. Providing a static string, instead of dynamically inserting the string, in the `href` attribute of the use tag still produces this bug. Some of the svgs render and some don't, even though they reference the same ID. \r\n\r\nCuriously, when I remove the map function and just render every item instead of filtering based on their value, each svg displays just fine even when clicking on a different result.\r\n\r\nSo it is not an issue with resolving IDs, and must be an issue with how dynamic rendering is handled when `svg` and/or `use` elements are involved. I'm not sure how this relates back to Chrome but I'm not surprised it's browser-specific because the Chrome dev team loves to break shit. For all I know, this is purely a Chrome bug and mithril's implementation is correct.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\nFor the sake of clarity, I have greatly simplified the following components.\r\n\r\nThe relevant components include a container, a component containing the `svg` element, and the model `Items` that contains information about each item. \r\n\r\n`vnode.attrs.items` is formatted as \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  item1: true / false,\r\n  item2: true / false,\r\n  item3: true / false, \r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `Items` is formatted as \r\n```\r\n[\r\n  item1: {\r\n    name: <name>,\r\n    icon: '/spritesheet.svg#sprite-<name>'\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe indexes of both `vnode.attrs.items` and `Items` are the same for each item, and thusly the container converts `vnode.attrs.items` to an array of keys and values with `Object.entries` and loops through each entry and if the value is `true`, retrieves the relevant information from `Items`.\r\n\r\nContainer:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction MyContainer() {\r\n  return {\r\n    view: ( vnode ) => (\r\n      <div>\r\n        {\r\n          Object.entries( vnode.attrs.items )\r\n          // Render the component if the value is true\r\n            .map(( x, i ) => (\r\n              x[1] ?\r\n                <MyComponent\r\n                  key={ i }\r\n                  name={ Items.list[ i ].name }\r\n                  icon={ Items.list[ i ].icon }\r\n                />\r\n                : undefined\r\n            ))\r\n        }\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nComponent:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction MyComponent() {\r\n  return {\r\n    view: ( vnode ) => (\r\n      <div>\r\n          <svg class={ 'icon' }>\r\n            <use href={ vnode.attrs.icon }/>\r\n          </svg>\r\n\r\n          <span>\r\n            { String( vnode.attrs.name )}\r\n          </span>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nI have a list of search results. I am pulling a list of attributes from a document that changes whenever a result is clicked. This document is pulled in a parent component and only the attributes are passed through (as `items`). These attributes have associated full names (item1 -> \"Item 1\") and icons. The icons are stored as strings referencing the appropriate path and id of the svg symbol, and the appropriate svg is loaded from the external spritesheet on render.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n* Version used: 1.1.5\r\n* Browser Name and version: Chrome 61.0.3163.100 (64-bit)\r\n* Operating System and version (desktop or mobile): Fedora 26\r\n* Webpack + Babel + JSX\r\n\r\n\r\nI know this bug is a bit complicated so I am happy to provide further context upon request.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/photonstorm/phaser/issues/4381","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/photonstorm/phaser","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/photonstorm/phaser/issues/4381/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/photonstorm/phaser/issues/4381/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/photonstorm/phaser/issues/4381/events","html_url":"https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/4381","id":411758520,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTE3NTg1MjA=","number":4381,"title":"multi canvas has problem","user":{"login":"shaoahs","id":6211108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMTExMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6211108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoahs","html_url":"https://github.com/shaoahs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoahs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoahs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoahs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoahs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoahs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoahs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoahs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoahs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoahs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":968407584,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Njg0MDc1ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/photonstorm/phaser/labels/%F0%9F%91%8EWon't%20Fix","name":"👎Won't Fix","color":"cc10a9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":907762992,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDc3NjI5OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/photonstorm/phaser/labels/%F0%9F%99%8F%20Help%20Wanted","name":"🙏 Help Wanted","color":"e3f464","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-02-19T05:58:50Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T13:41:56Z","closed_at":"2019-07-17T13:41:56Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Version\r\n<!--\r\nEnter the version of Phaser you're using.

It does work in Firefox and Safari.\r\n\r\n- Chrome version: 75.0.3770.80\r\n- Firefox version: 68.0b6\r\n- Safari version: 12.1.1 (14607.2.6.1.1)\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\r\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\r\n\r\n- Mithril should redraw automatically when an Ajax request finishes.\r\n- Mithril should behave consistently between Chrome and Firefox at the very least.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\r\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\r\n\r\n- The redraw callback is never called in Chrome.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\r\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\r\n\r\nI tried stepping through Mithril in the browser debugger on Chrome and Firefox to figure out what is different between the two, and in Chrome it seems like this callback is never getting invoked: https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/blob/v1.1.6/request/request.js#L20-L26. Maybe Chrome does not allow reassigning `then` on a native `Promise` object? If that is the case, maybe there's some other way of doing this, like creating a new promise and wrapping the old one.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I am calling `m.redraw()` manually at the end of my oninit lifecycle in my actual application (company Intranet project).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->\r\n<!--- reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->\r\n\r\nHere is an example tiny app that reproduces the problem:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n    <head>\r\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n        <title>Demo</title>\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n        <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/mithril@1.1.6/mithril.js\"></script>\r\n        <script>\r\n            class Page {\r\n                async oninit(vnode) {\r\n                    let response = await m.request(\"https://reqres.in/api/users/2\");\r\n                    this.user = response.data;\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                view(vnode) {\r\n                    return m(\"main\", [\r\n                        m(\"h1\", \"Demo App\"),\r\n                        this.user ? m(User, {\r\n                            user: this.user,\r\n                        }) : \"Loading...\"\r\n                    ]);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            class User {\r\n                view(vnode) {\r\n                    return [\r\n                        m(\"p\", `Name: ${vnode.attrs.user.first_name} ${vnode.attrs.user.last_name}`),\r\n                        m(\"p\", `Email: ${vnode.attrs.user.email}`),\r\n                    ];\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            m.mount(document.body, Page);\r\n        </script>\r\n    </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Firefox, this shows `Loading...` for a short time and then displays user information. On Chrome, this displays `Loading...` forever unless you call `m.redraw()` manually in the JavaScript console.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n<!--- How has this issue affected you?

Issue Type\r\n\r\n- Bug Report\r\n\r\n##### Summary\r\n\r\nOn the old plugins page, we had explicitly rendered the modal contents without escaping (https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/4226/files#diff-768a61bc4d59d2c699d5f45a6da3dd03L15). This meant that any script that was present in the plugin view template could be executed. After upgrading the mithril 1.1.6, this behaviour was broken even though we use `m.trust` for rendering the plugin view template.  This is due to a breaking change introduced when we moved from mithril 0.2.3 to 1.1.6. It is being followed in https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/2168.
