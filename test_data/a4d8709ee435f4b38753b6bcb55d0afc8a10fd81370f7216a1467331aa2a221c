This has been corrected. As documented, the only size that now remains accessible is the `one-sixth` size, and this choice can be changed or eliminated entirely. **This bug did not affect other file attachments, such as PDFs.**\n\nAs always, be sure to run the `apostrophe-migrations:migrate` task. This will make sure the permissions of your files are correct. Harmless warnings may appear for those that were already correct.\n\n* The `apostrophe-attachments:migrate-to-disabled-file-key` and `apostrophe-attachments:migrate-from-disabled-file-key` have been added for the convenience of those using the `disabledFileKey` option to `uploadfs` to rename disabled files in a cryptographically sound way rather than changing their permissions. These are relevant only with the `local` storage option of `uploadfs`, since since the option is neither available nor necessary for S3, and is mandatory for Azure from the beginning.\n\n* Although technically part of UploadFS 1.9.0, we'd like to note that the `azure` storage backend is now available and can be part of your `uploadfs` configuration for the `apostrophe-attachments` module.\n\n* Server-side modules can now extend the buttons available in the \"manage\" modal of pieces without overriding templates, similar to the way they are extensible in the \"edit\" modal.\n\n* UX fixes.\n\n* Cropping an image through Apostrophe now works when attachments are stored in S3, Azure, etc.\n\n* Date parsing does not generate `momentjs` warnings.\n\n* Overrideable block in the outerLayout for the context menu.\n\n* The `apostrophe-soft-redirects` module now accepts a `statusCode` option, which you may change to `301` to use hard redirects. Thanks to Leo Melzer.","tree":{"sha":"79451554a3a7763e355e429b31ae0eb659a183d1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apostrophecms/apostrophe/git/trees/79451554a3a7763e355e429b31ae0eb659a183d1"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apostrophecms/apostrophe/git/commits/1a1474a45807c026f1acbe86835889b810aa189b","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apostrophecms/apostrophe/commits/1a1474a45807c026f1acbe86835889b810aa189b","html_url":"https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/commit/1a1474a45807c026f1acbe86835889b810aa189b","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apostrophecms/apostrophe/commits/1a1474a45807c026f1acbe86835889b810aa189b/comments","author":{"login":"boutell","id":32125,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell","html_url":"https://github.com/boutell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"boutell","id":32125,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell","html_url":"https://github.com/boutell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"1e3e57d7eac769f5966a2b6eb2f0afbee4f28820","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apostrophecms/apostrophe/commits/1e3e57d7eac769f5966a2b6eb2f0afbee4f28820","html_url":"https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/commit/1e3e57d7eac769f5966a2b6eb2f0afbee4f28820"}]},{"sha":"1e3e57d7eac769f5966a2b6eb2f0afbee4f28820","commit":{"author":{"name":"Tom
