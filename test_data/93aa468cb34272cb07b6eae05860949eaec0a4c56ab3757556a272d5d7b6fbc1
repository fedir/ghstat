entirely correct. but I also tried the link above: https://github.com/morethanreal/enyo-googlemap\n\nUsing just that example also causes the content to load just a gray panel, It looks like Google's JavaScript and map are running but none of the image tiles ever load.\n\n``` javascript\nenyo.kind({\n  name: \"mapTest\",\n  kind: enyo.Control,\n  components: [\n    {name: 'map', classes: 'map_canvas'}\n  ],\n  create: function () {\n    this.inherited(arguments);\n  },\n  rendered: function () {\n    if (this.hasNode()) {\n      this.createMap();\n    }\n  },\n  createMap: function () {\n    if (this.$.map.hasNode()) {\n      new googlemaps.Map(this.$.map.node, {<MAP_CONFIG_OPTS>});\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nI can change back and forth between 2.0.1b and 2.0.2b, without changing any of my Enyo components and 2.0.2b somehow no longer works with Google Maps correctly.\n\nThank you for any help.\n\np.s.\noriginaly posted and reqested to be moved here

a little confused by how UiComponent deals with chrome. It seems to me that if a user calls destroy on an instance that has chrome, surely the contents of the client should be destroyed and not the entirety including chrome - at least this is the behaviour I would expect. \n\nSo instead of having destroyClientControls, destroy should perform that functionality and a new function, destroyClient should be introduced for special cases where the user intends to destroy the chrome (which most of the time they won't be intending to, but may accidentally do so with the current implementation).\n\nI understand if you put this down to personal preference but I do wonder how many others found the interface a little unintuitive.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
