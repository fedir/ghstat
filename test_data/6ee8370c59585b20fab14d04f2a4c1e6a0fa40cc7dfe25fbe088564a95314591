The original requirements are:\r\n\r\n* Create a destination that will allow users with appropriate access to upload large files (up to\r\n30GB). \r\n* Each upload shall be accessible through a unique public download URL that has to be manually shared.  \r\n* Files shall automatically be removed and expire after 45 days.\r\n* These dropbox files should be organized in a way where admins can see a list of all the currently available ones.\r\n* Admins should be able to control via permissions who has the ability to create a new dropbox file.  (they will allow garrisons to do this from time to time)\r\n* Uploading of large files over HTTPS will be a concern and we should do our best to make sure this works smoothly. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking this should be a custom concrete5 package installable via composer that adds the components to make this run smoothly, from a front-end and back-end perspective. \r\n\r\nCreate package that installs via composer.

This should use a GUID/UUID file as its primary identifier, a separate UUID/GUID that's private as its fileIdentifier, along with an original filename (a string), a unix timestamp of when the file was uploaded, and a description field. Let's also join it to the `Concrete\\Core\\Entity\\User\\User.php` entity (but make this nullable.)\r\n* Let's create a block type called Dropbox. You can add this to the page. This should use custom JavaScript that enables a nice interface with a progress bar. It should *not* use dropzone; instead, build a custom JS client using https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client so we can handle large uploads.\r\n* Any endpoint that TUS JS Requires let's use the routing/controller system in concrete5 to add these routes to the Dropbox package. \r\n* Add a new \"Upload File to Dropbox\" custom permission that's accessible from the file permissions dashboard page. Use this permission when uploading through the dropbox block. \r\n* Let's add a Dashboard > System and Settings > Files > Dropbox Settings dashboard page where we can put any settings that we need to to make this configurable. \r\n* Uploading files through this dropbox should store them in a secure location on the server. This should be configurable through the Dropbox Settings dashboard page.\r\n*  Add a new Dashboard page at Dashboard > Files > Dropbox. Use the styles of the File Manager, Logs, Page Search, etc... to make this look nice. It should show all uploaded files and let administrators get the public URL of the file, as well as delete the file. \r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/7138","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/7138/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/7138/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5/concrete5/issues/7138/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/7138","id":365132232,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjUxMzIyMzI=","number":7138,"title":"concrete5 version 8 with PHP version 7.3","user":{"login":"mlocati","id":928116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODExNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/928116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati","html_url":"https://github.com/mlocati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mlocati","id":928116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODExNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/928116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati","html_url":"https://github.com/mlocati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mlocati","id":928116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODExNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/928116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati","html_url":"https://github.com/mlocati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlocati/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":19,"created_at":"2018-09-29T13:23:23Z","updated_at":"2020-11-12T21:39:49Z","closed_at":"2019-01-17T16:18:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"concrete5 version 8 won't run on PHP 7.3.\r\nThe reason is that concrete5 uses Doctrine ORM version 2.5, which is not compatible with PHP 7.3.

There's certainly a logic to that, but if you look at systems like OS X/Linux that's really not how a multi user system works, and the file manager is increasingly being used by larger teams. \r\n\r\nLet's add the concept of a Home Folder to the file manager. First, let's make some things clear:\r\n\r\nThis *does not* mean that every user has their own unique folder (e.g. \"andrew\" as a folder in the root level.). Some admins could certainly set this up if they wanted to, but it's not the default.\r\nThis *does not* mean that a home folder is unique per user. Multiple users can have the same home folder. It's really just a \"file manager starting point bookmark\", but I like the name Home Folder.\r\n\r\nAll this functionality is is the following.\r\n\r\n1. Add `homeFileManagerFolderID` to the `Concrete\\Core\\Entity\\User\\User` entity. Default it to null.\r\n2. When I come to the file manager search interface in the dashboard, if my user record has a file manager folder ID tied to it, that's the folder that I start in. Everything else is the same. I can navigate via breadcrumb to the root level, navigate in, etc...\r\n3. When creating users we don't do anything different. They have a null homeFileManagerfolderID until they set it themselves or an admin sets it. This might change in the future but let's start here to make this as simple a change as possible.\r\n4. Let's modify the user view and user edit screens in the dashboard to show if the user has a home folder ID. If they do, make it clickable so an admin can link in to the home folder easily.\r\n5.

They get loaded into session when you login. These are used extensively within the updated Dashboard panel, so that the panel doesn't have to dynamically create the nav from the site's sitemap on each load. \r\n\r\nLet's do the same with the mobile menu. I've commented out the mobile menu code completely within the page_controls_footer.php include. Use the same approach as the Dashboard panel:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new element and controller at `dashboard/navigation/mobile`.\r\n2. Retrieve it from within the template using\r\n\r\n$menu = Element::get('dashboard/navigation/mobile');\r\n\r\n3. Render it using\r\n\r\n$menu->render()\r\n\r\nThis will give you places to create a controller and an element view. Use the navigation in the controller the same way that `Concrete\\Controller\\Element\\Dashboard\\Navigation\\Panel\\Top` does – retrieve the navigation for the dashboard, and output it in a nice formatted way.\r\n\r\nThe goal here? To bring back the mobile menu in a way that looks nice and works in Bootstrap 4, but built on this new approach that is much, much faster.

default behavior of select and radio options is to not have the 'required' option - the first option is always a selected one. However, it doesn't really work for bigger forms - people tend to just skip the fields that are already selected, and go directly to the \"Add to cart\" button, which leads to errors, since the form doesn't tell the user that he must select a certain field. The suggested fix changes the behavior in the following way:\r\n\r\n1. Required field is available on the 'select' options.\r\n2. When the required flag is set AND the first option value's name is empty, the 'required=\"required\"' is added to select, the first option's value is set to an empty string, and the 'disabled' attribute is added to it(so the user couldn't select that empty option value). As a result, if that required flag is set on select and the first option is not empty, that option value is used as the default(no change from current behavior) - however, if it's set and the first option is empty, the browser will force the user to select it. And the select still by default displays the label for the first option.\r\n3. In addition to those 2 conditions above(the required flag is set AND the first option value's name is empty), for the 'radio' display type, the 'selected' attribute is removed from the first option, as a result, the browser forces the user to pick up a value on radio button as well.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store/pull/572","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5-community-store/community_store_authorize_net/issues/5","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5-community-store/community_store_authorize_net","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5-community-store/community_store_authorize_net/issues/5/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5-community-store/community_store_authorize_net/issues/5/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concrete5-community-store/community_store_authorize_net/issues/5/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store_authorize_net/issues/5","id":583192935,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1ODMxOTI5MzU=","number":5,"title":"Error installing Authorize.net Add-on","user":{"login":"craigmarcussen","id":10426078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI2MDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10426078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigmarcussen","html_url":"https://github.com/craigmarcussen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigmarcussen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigmarcussen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigmarcussen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigmarcussen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigmarcussen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigmarcussen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigmarcussen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigmarcussen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigmarcussen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-03-17T17:53:15Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T15:19:53Z","closed_at":"2020-09-30T15:19:53Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nFirst off let me say that I love the Community Store Add-on!
