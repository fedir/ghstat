I am aware that cabins were removed and there was conversation two years ago, however, I'd like to revive the conversation please.\r\nhttps://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/pull/774\r\n\r\nOn May 31, 2018 westnordost in the link above said:\r\nremoved cabin - definition unclear, not well defined what is the difference to bungalow (small holiday/garden/summer home or dacha), shed (small building for tools), hut (crude/simple shelter or dwelling)\r\n\r\nI would claim that the difference between bungalow and cabin is negligible. Thus, one potential solution is to add cabin to the bungalow description in parenthesis. However, where I think this will cause confusion is that in the U.S. bungalow is not a common term. However, in all the national and state parks that I've been to (quite a few) that offer these types of accommodations, the term used is cabin. Where this also gets a little muddled is that there are camping cabins with full amenities and there are mutli-family camping cabins. Some of my preferred camping cabins are single room and there's only one door the four walls. However, I've stayed at a six (!) room 2 full-bathrooms camping cabin in the mountains before and that was the largest of the cabins on the state park grounds where the single and dual rooms were more common. Thus, in my opinion, the biggest difference between bungalow being a generic get-a-way building and a cabin is the location of cabins both in the geographic North America term sense as well as the \"hidden in the woods on a mountain or some other nature environment like a national or state park\". \r\n\r\nA shed is a small building for tools. Most of the modern cabins at campgrounds have power, air conditioning, beds, ect. However, running water and bathrooms is rare as there is usually a shared common bathroom for the camp.\r\n\r\nA hut is more likely to be made of sticks, grass, and mud with dirt floors. Arguing the difference between a hut and a cabin from like the early 1800's that is still standing as a historical piece is a pretty close call as cabins from then were pretty basic. But modern cabins (last 100+ years) I would contend have no likeness to huts.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**\r\nPersonally, I'd like to see a building type of Cabin. Even if it is just regionally shown in North America.\r\n\r\nHowever, if bungalow is the preferred term by the community then I'd like for that to be clear in the description of a bungalow. \r\n\r\nI hope I've made things more clear. Thank you for your time listening to my feedback.

Since then, @mtmorgan has directed me to your `biocthis` package as it has some helpful functionality to create a Bioconductor style package. \r\n\r\nI have two forks in my personal GitHub, one of [AnnotationHubData](https://github.com/Kayla-Morrell/AnnotationHubData/tree/biocthisUse) where I've been working on the new functions and one of [biocthis](https://github.com/Kayla-Morrell/biocthis/tree/KaylaEdits) where I've made some slight modifications to `use_bioc_description()` to accommodate AH and EH type packages. \r\n\r\nWe were hoping we could discuss with you a bit about what your intentions might be with `biocthis`. We think it would be a great addition to Bioconductor, as it would be useful not only for our Hub purposes but for other developers as well. Let us know what your thoughts are, we would be more than happy to discuss further with you and/or answer any questions you may have.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nKayla","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/issues/7442","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kunena/Kunena-Forum","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/issues/7442/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/issues/7442/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/issues/7442/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/issues/7442","id":679781976,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2Nzk3ODE5NzY=","number":7442,"title":"font-awesome pro (5.x) are not displayed with kunena 5.1.19","user":{"login":"carabao72","id":8301011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDEwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8301011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carabao72","html_url":"https://github.com/carabao72","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carabao72/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carabao72/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carabao72/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carabao72/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carabao72/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carabao72/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carabao72/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carabao72/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carabao72/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":199722195,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTk3MjIxOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/labels/Crypsis","name":"Crypsis","color":"009800","default":false,"description":null},{"id":121335,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjEzMzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"e10c02","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2020-08-16T16:19:44Z","updated_at":"2020-08-17T15:30:14Z","closed_at":"2020-08-17T15:24:56Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"****Describe the bug**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.**\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI just updated to 5.1.19 and coincidence or not, my font-awesomne PRO icons no longer appear, they are replaced by a circle with one!\r\n\r\nAt first glance, the font classes have been changed from version 5.1.18.

Literally nothing a player can reasonably do will prevent the character from dying. At this point, it would be better to just outright kill the character on the spot, instead of forcing player into hours (potentially) of \"dead-end\" game-play.\r\nDirect damage also completely overshadows potentially interesting challenge of having to survive for a few days while severely weakened.\r\n\r\n# Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nGet enough poison stacks (by breathing gas from bloated zombie or something).\r\nWait and see.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPoison should progressively weaken the character, but shouldn't deal lethal damage to critical limbs (head and torso) **directly**. Within the current system, simply disabling damage (while keeping the pain) already leads (progressively, over several hours)  to -40% or more pain speed reduction, 0 focus, huge stat penalties, etc, etc. Maybe also add extra fatigue accumulation over time, large health penalty, etc. Maybe keep the damage initially, but prevent it from directly bringing the limb below 10 HP or so.\r\n\r\n#
