With the following change (DEPS being removed - Commit Modernize Tracker package), Iron Router doesn't work anymore as it will throw a DEPS not defined error.  \r\n\r\nTo get around this, I copied deprecated.js into tracker and added the necessary parameters in the (3) json files. (os.json, web.browser.json, web.browser.legacy.json).  \r\n\r\nDepreceated.js\r\n```\r\n// Deprecated functions.\r\n\r\n// These functions used to be on the Meteor object (and worked slightly\r\n// differently).\r\n// XXX COMPAT WITH 0.5.7\r\nMeteor.flush = Tracker.flush;\r\nMeteor.autorun = Tracker.autorun;\r\n\r\n// We used to require a special \"autosubscribe\" call to reactively subscribe to\r\n// things. Now, it works with autorun.\r\n// XXX COMPAT WITH 0.5.4\r\nMeteor.autosubscribe = Tracker.autorun;\r\n\r\n// This Tracker API briefly existed in 0.5.8 and 0.5.9\r\n// XXX COMPAT WITH 0.5.9\r\nTracker.depend = function (d) {\r\n  return d.depend();\r\n};\r\n\r\nDeps = Tracker;\r\n```\r\nJson Files (Added)\r\n```\r\n{\r\n      \"name\": \"Deps\",\r\n      \"testOnly\": false\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n&\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n      \"type\": \"source\",\r\n      \"extension\": \"js\",\r\n      \"file\": \"os/deprecated.js\",\r\n      \"length\": 543,\r\n      \"offset\": 0,\r\n      \"usesDefaultSourceProcessor\": true,\r\n      \"path\": \"deprecated.js\",\r\n      \"hash\": \"e6bc5717d7b2d73d327808fbd89fc4687a153b56\",\r\n      \"fileOptions\": {}\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nUntil I can move a few projects over to a different router, is this workaround the best option, or is there a flag one could use instead of doing it the manual way?\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9829","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9829/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9829/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9829/events","html_url":"https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9829","id":316250330,"number":9829,"title":"Meteor.call callback \"error\" parameter has an exception from the core","user":{"login":"github0013","id":809378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/809378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github0013","html_url":"https://github.com/github0013","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github0013/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github0013/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github0013/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github0013/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github0013/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github0013/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github0013/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github0013/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github0013/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-04-20T12:36:09Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T12:48:15Z","closed_at":"2018-04-20T12:48:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## environments\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nuname -a\r\nDarwin mac 16.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 16.7.0: Mon Nov 13 21:56:25 PST 2017;

But here goes...\r\n\r\nWe have a fairly large codebase running in Meteor that is fetching data from outside APIs and storing it in Collections for reactivity.  We even have fetches running on intervals to keep it up to date.  What we do is add a `lastUpdated` `Date` field to our data on every run and then remove all data that falls outside the scope of that date.  But what we've been seeing, and this goes back many version of Meteor, is that sometimes the data we insert/upsert also gets deleted.\r\n\r\nOur theory is this, especially since we haven't been able to reproduce this locally and only observed this in production:  Because of latency between Meteor and MongoDB the data we just updated is still not updated in MongoDB when we trigger the removal.  Therefore we are sometimes (rarely, thankfully) removing \"good\" data when we shouldn't.\r\n\r\nSo our question is this:  Is it possible to \"wait\" for the insert/upsert action to be truly finished before we call our removal?\r\n\r\nAnd, follow-up question:  Would it be possible to make Collection actions promisable if/when needed?  `Collection.insert({...}, { promise: true }).then(...)`","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9818","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9818/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9818/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9818/events","html_url":"https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9818","id":314547133,"number":9818,"title":"ie10
