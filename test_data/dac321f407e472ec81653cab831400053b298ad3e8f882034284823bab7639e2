Registration process would drop after showing this error\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in defer callback: Error: The Mongo server and the Meteor query disagree on how many documents match your query. Maybe it is hitting a Mongo edge case? The query is: {}\r\n```\r\n(Searched for this error and found out that the issue is tracked in #9087 and a solution is to be patched soon in #9671 )\r\n\r\nHere are a few interesting things that are happening:\r\n- Even though the register action is dropped, the new user document is created.\r\n- We can not log in using this new user credentials even though all fields are there.\r\n- All previously created users can still be logged in, no problem there.\r\n- We have been saving some data in the `profile` field. On the new user document, if we delete the `profile` field, we can log in to these accounts again.\r\n- All problems vanish once you reset database, that is why we are not being able to reproduce the issues locally. The issue is currently happening in our remote staging server. \r\n\r\nOf course, we can not reset the database in our staging or production servers. So, we were looking for someone to explain what exactly is causing these problems so that we can work on a fix.
