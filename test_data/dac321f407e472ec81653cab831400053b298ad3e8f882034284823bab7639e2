Deploy meteor bundle and install it on the CentOS server.\r\n\r\n2. Create MongoDB replication set for meteor app which consists of 3 nodes.\r\nThe following ENV variables are defined:\r\nMONGO_URL=mongodb://<first_mongo_instance>:3001,<second_mongo_instance>:3001,<third_mongo_instance>:3001/meteor?replicaSet=meteor\r\nMONGO_OPLOG_URL=mongodb://<first_mongo_instance>:3001,<second_mongo_instance>:3001,<third_mongo_instance>:3001/local?replicaSet=meteor\r\n\r\n3.

Shut down 2 or three mongo nodes, wait for some time, so the app throws some errors like \"connection refused\" or 'failed to connect to server', etc.\r\n\r\n5. Start the MongoDB replica again\r\n6.

Try to update something in the DB to check the reactivity\r\n\r\nThe actual behavior: the app is hung until it's restarted, it doesn't update any reactive data, the periodical tasks are not performed, a WebSocket connection is established, but it doesn't populate any data, just 'pings'.\r\n\r\nThe expected result: the meteor server is crashed on DB connection errors with some error code > 0. \r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\nThe application works correctly while changing the Primary node within the replica set but not always, unfortunately. And it is always stuck when no DB connection available at all.\r\nI believe something similar has already been fixed within https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/3038\r\nHowever, it seems that the fix doesn't work for the production app.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9958","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9958/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9958/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9958/events","html_url":"https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9958","id":330088064,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzAwODgwNjQ=","number":9958,"title":"Unexpected mongo exit code 62.

to Meteor `v1.6.1.1` or `v1.7.0.1` from `v1.5.2.2` causes strange UI breaking in our app that's still using Blaze, but only on Safari (so far).\r\n\r\nI posted this here, since the Blaze repository is quite dead and I believe this has something to do with the upgrade from Meteor `1.5.x` to `1.6.x`/`1.7.x`\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe app would work just fine for 30 seconds or few minutes and then suddenly break in the weirdest ways:\r\n\r\n- 5 out of 6 identical buttons might not get rendered properly, instead showing an empty basic button element\r\n- Element styles would just disappear (from some elements, not all)\r\n- The app would freeze for 10 seconds after a simple button click or slow down to a crawl for a moment\r\n- Buttons might just stop working\r\n- Attributes might be missing from elements\r\n\r\n![screencapture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17210302/40823264-6f9fd2ce-6578-11e8-827a-adcdf89bf6c3.png)\r\n\r\nIt might also break down on page load or reload, approximately maybe 1 out of 20 times.\r\n\r\nThe issue is really hard to reproduce. There was no sure way to make it happen, except for just using the actual app for a few minutes in random ways. At least I couldn't find any clear patterns.\r\n\r\nThe lines of app code leading up to the crash seemed quite random. You never know which component will crash.\r\n\r\nFrom all the logs I've tried to inspect, most of which were minified since I first thought this only happened on production bundles, it seems usually the problem is that `viewmodel` is trying to get a hold of the template instance from Blaze, but instead gets null. Meaning `_currentTemplateInstanceFunc` is null or returns null when called.\r\n\r\nI tried a bunch of stuff to fix the issue, including\r\n\r\n- jQuery versions between `v2.2.4` and `v3.3.1`\r\n- Updating `minifier-js`, `babel-compiler`, `modules`, `ecmascript` and `@babel/runtime` to latest versions\r\n- Updating to Meteor v1.7.0.1\r\n\r\nThe issue was hard to detect because it would only manifest when using Safari and when _actually using the app_. Tests didn't help.\r\n\r\nSo far I've been able to reproduce this problem on all Apple devices I've tried:\r\n\r\n- MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) running Safari 11.1\r\n- MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running Safari 11.1.1\r\n- iPhone 6 running iOS 10\r\n- iPhone SE running iOS 11\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9925","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9925/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9925/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/9925/events","html_url":"https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9925","id":328349436,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjgzNDk0MzY=","number":9925,"title":"[1.7.0.1]
