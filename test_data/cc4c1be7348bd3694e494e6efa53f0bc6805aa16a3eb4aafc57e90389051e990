Questions\r\n\r\nAs per the question raised [here](https://groups.google.com/g/vertx/c/q1RcCnLVQZM) regarding to changes made in Vert.x 3.9.3 around websocket close handling.\r\n\r\nIn Vert.x 3.9.2, closing a websocket would result in a close frame being sent to the client (to instruct it to close). With version 3.9.3, this code seems to have changed significantly. We observed that when we do an abrupt server close , the close mechanism is now propagated to the client by just closing the websocket connection (or channel). Close frames are not sent from the server (or returned from the client).\r\n\r\nBy abrupt server close, I mean: `httpServer.close();`\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\nVert.x 3.9.3\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nI encountered an exception which looks suspicious while ...\r\n\r\nAs part of our product, we test proxying websocket data from a Vert.x client to a Vert.x server but not using a Vert.x websocket proxy. Previously, when frames were used, the server close message was propagated by the proxy to the client. \r\n\r\nWith version 3.9.3, the proxy receives the connection/ channel close but _does not_ receive a close message. The proxy then cannot propagate the close to the client. The best it can do is close its own websocket connection to the client.\r\n\r\n(Side-issue unrelated to Vert.x: In our test, propagating the close to the client is not as straightforward as you'd expect as the proxy is running in a Tomcat instance. Closing the websocket connection does not close the HTTP connection, so the client remains completely unaware of the close).\r\n\r\nWe do not see close frames being sent in either direction, as we did with Vert.x 3.9.2. We see only the FIN request from the server to the proxy and ACK in return.\r\n\r\n### Do you have a reproducer?\r\n\r\nJulien indicated this wouldn't be necessary for now but I'm happy to provide it if it helps.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Configure client and server with proxy between\r\n2. Open websocket to proxy - which propagates websocket upgrade request to server.\r\n3. 101 is returned from server, via proxy to client\r\n4. Abruptly close the server: `httpServer.close()`\r\n5. Observe that the client waits (until idleTimeout) as it has not been made aware of the close notification.\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached images taken from WireShark, showing the relevant comms between the client -> proxy -> server:\r\n- proxy-392.jpg shows the comms using Vert.x 3.9.2 - and clearly shows the websocket close frames being sent prior to the FIN (commencing at packet no 15850).\r\n- proxy-393.jpg shows the comms using Vert.x 3.9.3 - and shows only the connection closure (FIN - beginning with packet no 207).\r\n\r\n[client] --> [(8787) proxy] --> [(7878) server] arrangement: \r\n- The proxy is sitting on port 8787 and just passes messages received backwards and forwards between the client and server.\r\n- The server is sitting on port 7878.\r\n\r\nWireshark:\r\n- proxy-392:\r\n![proxy-392](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34578260/94035217-c0496000-fdba-11ea-9d1e-fc217bbccc35.jpg)\r\n-

The decrement of the value used for this gauge occurs when the `FlowableReadStream` created from a web-socket (using `FlowableHelper.toFlowable`) completes for any reason.

Every follow-up user is being denied write-access (as is policy and correct) and greeted with a cryptic message (which does not contain the directory having the issue). \r\nIssue 2: This even creates a persistent problem, since vert.x seems to not care to remove the directory when its process is shutting down.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is as follows:\r\na) using a dynamic & unique component to the name used, like /tmp/vertx-cache-$(md5($USER$PID$TIME))\r\nb) specifying the directory in the error message, if there's an access issue and\r\nc) removing it in the end, for /tmp is not a trashheap, even if it is cleaned during system boot\r\n\r\nWhy $USER, $PID and $TIME?\r\nSystemd is able to start processes simultaneously, so only using $USER and $TIME is likely to produce hash collisions. $PID is guaranteed to be different, so in theory it would be sufficient to just add the PID, but then forgetting to delete the directory during termination (or being killed with -9 and not being able to) might result in future processes reusing the PID and have the problem again. Adding $USER would mitigate that or at least only lead to the new process finding ancient stuff, but since that might not be desireable, $TIME adds that extra safety clip on top. Hashing the whole shebang is just to not blatantly giving everyone the information which process is using the directory.

the future are generic and when a future attached to a context is transformed, the completion flow performs a lot of un-necessary context dispatches leading to long stack traces.\r\n\r\nWe should avoid context dispatches for internal purposes and only perform context dispatch for final handlers set by the user.\r\n\r\nTransformations like `compose` or using a `Promise<T>` as an `Handler<AsyncResult<T>>` should perform direct invocation and bypass the context attached to the future.\r\n\r\nTo solve this we split `FutureImpl` into `FutureImpl` and `PromiseImpl` and we add an internal `Listener` interface that `FutureImpl` will deliver the event to.\r\n\r\n- calling `onComplete(Handler<AsyncResult<T>>)` wraps the handler as a `Listener` which either calls directly the handler or perform the context event emission.\r\n- `PromiseImpl` extends `FutureImpl` and implements the `Listener` interface\r\n- future transformation are now subclasses of `FutureImpl` and also implement the `Listener` interface\r\n\r\nHere is an example with transformation:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nVertxInternal vertx = (VertxInternal) Vertx.vertx();\r\nContextInternal ctx = vertx.getOrCreateContext();\r\nPromiseInternal<String> promise = ctx.promise();\r\npromise.future()\r\n  .compose(s -> ctx.succeededFuture(s.length()))\r\n  .compose(s -> ctx.succeededFuture(\" \" + s))\r\n  .onComplete(ar -> {\r\n    new Exception().printStackTrace();\r\n});\r\nctx.runOnContext(v -> {\r\n  promise.complete(\"ABC\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently it leads to the stack trace

Version\r\n\r\n3.9.2\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nUnfortunately [this commit](https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/commit/343e1f9726fb908fd1f80f59047dccffed2c77c8#diff-91372f99f884daaf1678eb0b504efee1) broke something for us after upgrading to 3.9.2. We use a `RecordParser` to parse a chunked http response. The `RecordParser` is trying to re-use the input buffers for parsing but when using ssl, the response buffers returned by netty have their internal `maxCapacity` set to the length of the chunk, which means nothing can be added to these buffers. As a consequence, the following exception occurs:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: writerIndex(1) + minWritableBytes(1) exceeds maxCapacity(1): UnpooledByteBufAllocator$InstrumentedUnpooledUnsafeDirectByteBuf(ridx: 0, widx: 1, cap: 1/1)\r\n  at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.ensureWritable0(AbstractByteBuf.java:295)\r\n  at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.ensureWritable(AbstractByteBuf.java:282)\r\n  at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.writeBytes(AbstractByteBuf.java:1104)\r\n  at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.writeBytes(AbstractByteBuf.java:1097)\r\n  at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.writeBytes(AbstractByteBuf.java:1088)\r\n  at io.netty.buffer.WrappedByteBuf.writeBytes(WrappedByteBuf.java:780)\r\n  at io.vertx.core.buffer.impl.BufferImpl.appendBuffer(BufferImpl.java:209)\r\n  at io.vertx.core.parsetools.impl.RecordParserImpl.handle(RecordParserImpl.java:283)\r\n  at io.vertx.reactivex.core.parsetools.RecordParser.handle(RecordParser.java:460)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproducer\r\n\r\nHere is a reproducer that succeeds with Vert.x 3.9.1 but fails with Vert.x 3.9.2:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void testRecordParser(TestContext ctx) {\r\n  var o = Observable.fromArray(\"a\", \"\\n\", \"b\\nc\")\r\n    // this is how the buffers are returned from netty in a chunked ssl http response:\r\n    .map(s -> Buffer.buffer(UnpooledByteBufAllocator.DEFAULT.directBuffer(s.length(), s.length())).appendString(s));\r\n    \r\n  RecordParser.newDelimited(\"\\n\", o).toObservable()\r\n    .doOnNext(b -> System.out.println(\"parsed: \" + b.toString()))\r\n    .ignoreElements()\r\n    .subscribe(CompletableHelper.toObserver(ctx.asyncAssertSuccess()));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell the `RecordParser` now expects the buffers that it is given to be *writeable* which was not the case in the previous version. Was that change intentional?\r\n\r\n### Other Reproducer\r\n\r\nHere's another reproducer that demonstrates how we ran into this issue. The following test also passes with Vert.x 3.9.1 and fails/hangs with Vert.x 3.9.2 (we use H2 but it happens for both protocols):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@RunWith(VertxUnitRunner.class)\r\npublic class RecordParserTest {\r\n\r\n  private Vertx vertx;\r\n  private int port;\r\n\r\n  @Before\r\n  public void setUp(TestContext ctx) {\r\n    vertx = Vertx.vertx();\r\n    vertx.createHttpServer(new HttpServerOptions()\r\n      .setSsl(true)\r\n      .setPemKeyCertOptions(new PemKeyCertOptions()\r\n        // openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365\r\n        .setKeyPath(\"key.pem\")\r\n        .setCertPath(\"cert.pem\")))\r\n      .requestHandler(req -> req.response()\r\n        .setChunked(true)\r\n        .write(Buffer.buffer(\"a\"))\r\n        .write(Buffer.buffer(\"\\n\"))\r\n        .write(Buffer.buffer(\"b\\nc\"))\r\n        .end())\r\n      .rxListen(0)\r\n      .doOnSuccess(s -> port = s.actualPort())\r\n      .subscribe(SingleHelper.toObserver(ctx.asyncAssertSuccess()));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testGet(TestContext ctx) {\r\n    var req = vertx.createHttpClient(new HttpClientOptions()\r\n      .setSsl(true)\r\n      .setTrustAll(true)\r\n      .setDefaultPort(port)).get(\"/\");\r\n\r\n    var res = req.toObservable()\r\n      .firstOrError()\r\n      .flatMapObservable(HttpClientResponse::toObservable);\r\n\r\n    RecordParser.newDelimited(\"\\n\", res).toObservable()\r\n      .doOnNext(b -> System.out.println(\"received: \" + b.toString()))\r\n      .count()\r\n      .doOnSuccess(n -> ctx.assertEquals(3L, n))\r\n      .subscribe(SingleHelper.toObserver(ctx.asyncAssertSuccess()));\r\n\r\n    req.end();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur workaround for now is to copy the buffers before passing them to the `RecordParser` but I think it'd be better for the `RecordParser` to treat its input as read-only and manage the buffers it needs for parsing internally.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/3523","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/3523/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/3523/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/3523/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/3523","id":672825255,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NzI4MjUyNTU=","number":3523,"title":"[DNS

Start your onw DNS server (do not DDoS Official DNS servers...) I'm using consul\r\n```sh\r\n# Start consul as daemon with docker\r\ndocker run -e CONSUL_ALLOW_PRIVILEGED_PORTS=true -d --name consul --network host consul agent -dev -dns-port=53\r\n# Register domain names for the reproducer\r\ndocker exec consul consul services register -name one -address 10.0.0.1\r\ndocker exec consul consul services register -name two -address 10.0.0.2\r\ndocker exec consul consul services register -name three -address 10.0.0.3\r\ndocker exec consul consul services register -name four -address 10.0.0.4\r\n```\r\n2. Start the MainVerticle\r\n3. In general the issue appear between 1 and 5 minutes. You will see something like `Wrong ip due to id conflict, received 10.0.0.3 instead of 10.0.0.4`\r\n\r\n### Extra\r\n\r\nOS: Debian 10.5 Buster :rocket: \r\nJava: OpenJDK 14\r\nDocker: 19.03.12 (for consul)\r\n\r\n### Solutions\r\n\r\nIn the [DNS Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2181) I found this:\r\n```\r\n4. Server Reply Source Address Selection\r\n\r\n   Most, if not all, DNS clients, expect the address from which a reply\r\n   is received to be the same address as that to which the query\r\n   eliciting the reply was sent.  This is true for servers acting as\r\n   clients for the purposes of recursive query resolution, as well as\r\n   simple resolver clients.  The address, along with the identifier (ID)\r\n   in the reply is used for disambiguating replies, and filtering\r\n   spurious responses.  This may, or may not, have been intended when\r\n   the DNS was designed, but is now a fact of life.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the common usage is to use both the ID and address.\r\n\r\n**First solution**:\r\nMove `inProgressMap` from `<Integer, Query>` map to <String, Query> map. The string can be something like `${id}/${address}`\r\n\r\n**Second solution**:\r\nMove `inProgressMap` from `<Integer, Query>` map to <Pair<Integer, String>, Query> map. This one requires more code but may be easier to maintain ?\r\n\r\n:warning: When your query looks like `one.service.consul` in the response (`DnsResponse`) it will be `one.service.consul.` with a final dot.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/3584","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/3584/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/3584/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/3584/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/3584","id":710367726,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MTAzNjc3MjY=","number":3584,"title":"Vert.x HTTP server on port 0 and MQTT client issue","user":{"login":"cescoffier","id":402301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/402301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier","html_url":"https://github.com/cescoffier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":288937350,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODg5MzczNTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"207de5","default":true,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2020-09-28T15:27:17Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T09:22:02Z","closed_at":"2020-09-29T15:47:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Questions\r\n\r\nThis issue has been reproduced in Quarkus, but looks Vert.x specific. \r\n\r\nIn this use case, the HTTP verticle (start the HTTP server) instances (depending on the machine, but 8 in my case) are configured to listen on the port 0 (so dynamic binding).

information at hand or if it does not apply. Please remove every section which does not apply to the issue.\r\n-->\r\nIn Fabric8 Maven Plugin, we only used to detect and copy the main fat jar into final build archive. Here is an example from vertx-examples:\r\n```\r\n~/work/repos/vertx-examples/web-api-service-example : $ tree target/docker/\r\ntarget/docker/\r\n├── build.timestamp\r\n└── vertx\r\n    └── web-api-service-example\r\n        └── 3.9.0\r\n            ├── build\r\n            │   ├── Dockerfile\r\n            │   └── maven\r\n            │       └── web-api-service-example-3.9.0-fat.jar\r\n            ├── tmp\r\n            │   └── docker-build.tar\r\n            └── work\r\n```\r\nBut now with JKube, we're copying unnecessary jars into archive:\r\n```\r\n~/work/repos/vertx-examples/web-api-service-example : $ tree target/docker/\r\ntarget/docker/\r\n├── build.timestamp\r\n└── vertx\r\n    └── web-api-service-example\r\n        └──

      │   └── Dockerfile\r\n            ├── tmp\r\n            │   └── docker-build.tar\r\n            └── work\r\n\r\n7 directories, 5 files\r\n```\r\nThis creates confusion in our default opinionated image since it fails to detect which jar to run, This leads to additional configuration `JAVA_APP_JAR` environment variable and if not configured, this error:\r\n```\r\n/usr/local/s2i/run:
