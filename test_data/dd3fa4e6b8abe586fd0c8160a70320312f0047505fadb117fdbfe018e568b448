- MEB FAILS WHEN INNODB_LOG_FILE_SIZE IS DIFFERENT FOR INITIALIZE AND SERVER START\n\nMEB failed do scan the redo log up to its logical end under\ncircumstances. One such case was resizing of the log files.\nResizing can happen by shutdown and start of the server with\na new value for the log file size. The case was repeatable\nafter two resizes with one megabyte of extended size each.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in a new redo log format\n(version 3). In this format, the log header field\nLOG_HEADER_START_LSN does not always have the expected\nvalue. Instead the relation of LOG_CHECKPOINT_LSN and\nLOG_CHECKPOINT_OFFSET is significant for lsn to offset\ncalculations.\n\nSo far MEB relied on LOG_CHECKPOINT_LSN for lsn to offset\ncalculations. Due to the unreliable values, MEB could start\nto read the log from a wrong offset. It could get a\nzero-filled block, on which it assumed end of log.\n\nThis patch fixes the lsn to offset calculations. It gets rid\nof MEB's own calculation and calls an InnoDB function for\nthis calculation instead. (log_files_real_offset_for_lsn()\nfrom log0write.cc, log0log.h, log0types.h).\n\nIt does also fix the creation of the log files at restore\ntime. The checkpoint offset field needs to be set\nappropriately.\n\nUnrelated changes:\n\nFix variable types used for lsns and offsets. Lsns have\nlsn_t and offsets have utin64_t.\n\nReorder functions around the calculation in header and\nimplementation file to a consistent order.\n\nReduce the number of functions with similar signature.\n\nRename variables, so that the same name is used for the\nsame \"thing\" throughout.\n\nRename functions so, that a prefix of log_ is reserved for\nInnoDB functions, a prefix of meb_ is used for MEB\nfunctions, that are implemented inside InnoDB sources, a\nfunction name with get_ extracts information from memory\nstructures, a function name with read_ invloves reading of\ninformation from a file.\n\nMove meb_read_checkpoint_info from log0recv.cc to\nRedo_log_adapter::get_checkpoint_info().\n\nFix a message about parsing redo log when redo log was not\nparsed.\n\nFix tests, that used the message about parsing. Use the\nmessage about scanning instead.\n\nIn tests, use $MYSQLTEST_VARDIR/tmp for logs.\n$MYSQLTEST_VARDIR/log is not preserved by MTR after a\nfailing test. But the MEB logs are most valuable then.\n\nAdd new test script meb.log_size_increase to repeat the\nreported bug when the patch is not applied.\n\nRB#19145","tree":{"sha":"b0e93a55df874778cf508821c758bf7d11cecafd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mysql/mysql-server/git/trees/b0e93a55df874778cf508821c758bf7d11cecafd"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mysql/mysql-server/git/commits/009956eb73202d3fe65daf05f33b778cb1ae9092","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mysql/mysql-server/commits/009956eb73202d3fe65daf05f33b778cb1ae9092","html_url":"https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/009956eb73202d3fe65daf05f33b778cb1ae9092","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mysql/mysql-server/commits/009956eb73202d3fe65daf05f33b778cb1ae9092/comments","author":null,"committer":{"login":"dahlerlend","id":12152117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTUyMTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12152117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dahlerlend","html_url":"https://github.com/dahlerlend","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dahlerlend/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dahlerlend/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dahlerlend/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dahlerlend/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dahlerlend/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dahlerlend/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dahlerlend/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dahlerlend/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dahlerlend/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"47f80fc61f5494b4d6da84147c93a41291cda1d0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mysql/mysql-server/commits/47f80fc61f5494b4d6da84147c93a41291cda1d0","html_url":"https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/47f80fc61f5494b4d6da84147c93a41291cda1d0"}]},{"sha":"47f80fc61f5494b4d6da84147c93a41291cda1d0","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjQ0OTQwMzI6NDdmODBmYzYxZjU0OTRiNGQ2ZGE4NDE0N2M5M2E0MTI5MWNkYTFkMA==","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sivert
