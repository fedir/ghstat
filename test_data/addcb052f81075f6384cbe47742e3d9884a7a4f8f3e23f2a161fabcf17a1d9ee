There's nothing wrong with using it *alongside* Hunchentoot, in fact that's the way I use it. But Snooze is web-server-agnostic: I bundle it with a function that that easily plugs in Hunchentoot and another that plugs in Clack, but you can plug in whatever you want.\r\n\r\nI also don't think @fukamachi's Caveman or @Shirakumo's Radiance fit the bill of hunchentoot-basedness, but I might be wrong on those.  I do believe it's only true of RESTAS.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/azzamsa/awesome-cl-software/issues/8","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/azzamsa/awesome-cl-software","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/azzamsa/awesome-cl-software/issues/8/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/azzamsa/awesome-cl-software/issues/8/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/azzamsa/awesome-cl-software/issues/8/events","html_url":"https://github.com/azzamsa/awesome-cl-software/issues/8","id":283436502,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODM0MzY1MDI=","number":8,"title":"Web frameworks / web devel","user":{"login":"defunkydrummer","id":29258914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjU4OTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/29258914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/defunkydrummer","html_url":"https://github.com/defunkydrummer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defunkydrummer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defunkydrummer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defunkydrummer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defunkydrummer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defunkydrummer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defunkydrummer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defunkydrummer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defunkydrummer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defunkydrummer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-12-20T03:13:04Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T20:57:50Z","closed_at":"2018-01-05T20:57:50Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hi Azzamsa, \r\n\r\nFirst of all, thanks for this list. \r\n\r\nI would like to suggest you to add a section on web development.
