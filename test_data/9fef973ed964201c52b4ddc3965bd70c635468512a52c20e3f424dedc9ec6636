At least one member is understandably busy and intends to contribute further, but the rest have been absent without communication for most of 2018 if not much longer. \r\n\r\nThe effort to update Amber and the various dependant shards to Crystal 0.25 compatibility was almost entirely me, and 0.26 was no different.\r\n\r\nI have not published a release for Amber on 0.26 in an attempt to gauge the community awareness of and sensitivity too defunct maintainership. To raise awareness, if possible.\r\n\r\nRisk:\r\n\r\nMost significantly, Amber is the landing point for a lot of people evaluating Crystal for the first time. If Amber becomes _stale_, that diminishes the first time experience of a new Crystal user. This is what keeps me up at night.\r\n\r\nA project of this scale cannot continue without active maintainership. Any Amber projects in the wild run significant risk of becoming non-upgrade-able down the line.\r\n\r\nCrystal is a lovely language for many reasons, but it is young and work on the foundations means that releases are de-facto not backwards compatible. Every Crystal release runs the risk of crippling Amber significantly.\r\n\r\nFuture:\r\n\r\nIf you have work built on top of Amber, and you want Amber to continue, now is the time to speak up and get involved. Code needs refactoring, features need adding. \r\n\r\nIf this issue does not generate enough interest on some appropriate timeline, I'll do what I can to update the repositories and websites to recommend alternative projects and de-list Amber from the ranks of google, but I do not have admin access to all the various systems in place.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\n\r\nThe thing that makes me nervous about Amber falling stale isn't that the project is going to end, as all things must. Often this is the nature of open source.\r\n\r\nI would like it to not fizzle, spit, and die slowly, taking down people and projects with it. So I'm proposing an active de-comissioning of the project to avoid unnecessary casualties to the Crystal ecosystem, and perhaps spur on interest in other, more viable projects.\r\n\r\nMentions:\r\n\r\nIn no particular order, these people have made >1 commit to Amber or one of the Amber shards in the last 8 months. I'm mentioning them here because they are most likely to have a vested interest in the continued success of Amber.
