guys. I've been roaming through the codebase and found a place that I think is just plain wrong:\r\n\r\n[Cookie.scala:102][1]\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n      * The cookie's max age, in seconds, when we expire the cookie.\r\n      * This is also used to determine Expires. It's set to one day\r\n      * ago to work for clients that only support Expires and have\r\n      * a clock that is slightly behind.\r\n      */\r\n      val DiscardedMaxAge: Int = -1.day.toSeconds.toInt\r\n    }\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/0f18b8debd5d4c12948db735567491b199eb1bb2/framework/src/play/src/main/scala/play/api/mvc/Cookie.scala#L102\r\n\r\nI believe you don't need to use a negative `Max-Age` value to discard the cookie. Zero should be enough. In fact, it's the most portable way available.\r\n\r\n[RFC 6265 (the actual standard)][2]\r\n\r\n    4.1.2.2.  The Max-Age Attribute\r\n\r\n    The Max-Age attribute indicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie,\r\n    represented as the number of seconds until the cookie expires.  The\r\n    user agent is not required to retain the cookie for the specified\r\n    duration.  In fact, user agents often evict cookies due to memory\r\n    pressure or privacy concerns.\r\n\r\n       NOTE: Some existing user agents do not support the Max-Age\r\n       attribute.  User agents that do not support the Max-Age attribute\r\n       ignore the attribute.\r\n\r\n    If a cookie has both the Max-Age and the Expires attribute, the Max-\r\n    Age attribute has precedence and controls the expiration date of the\r\n    cookie.  If a cookie has neither the Max-Age nor the Expires\r\n    attribute, the user agent will retain the cookie until \"the current\r\n    session is over\" (as defined by the user agent).\r\n\r\n    If delta-seconds is less than or equal to zero (0), let expiry-time\r\n    be the earliest representable date and time.  Otherwise, let the\r\n    expiry-time be the current date and time plus delta-seconds seconds\r\n\r\n[RFC 2965 (obsolete)][3]\r\n\r\n    Max-Age=value\r\n      OPTIONAL.  The value of the Max-Age attribute is delta-seconds,\r\n      the lifetime of the cookie in seconds, a decimal non-negative\r\n      integer.  To handle cached cookies correctly, a client SHOULD\r\n      calculate the age of the cookie according to the age calculation\r\n      rules in the HTTP/1.1 specification [RFC2616].  When the age is\r\n      greater than delta-seconds seconds, the client SHOULD discard the\r\n      cookie.  A value of zero means the cookie SHOULD be discarded\r\n      immediately.\r\n\r\n[RFC 2109 (prehistoric)][4]\r\n\r\n    Max-Age=delta-seconds\r\n      Optional.  The Max-Age attribute defines the lifetime of the\r\n      cookie, in seconds.  The delta-seconds value is a decimal non-\r\n      negative integer.  After delta-seconds seconds elapse, the client\r\n      should discard the cookie.  A value of zero means the cookie\r\n      should be discarded immediately.\r\n\r\n[2]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-4.1\r\n[3]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2965\r\n[4]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2109\r\n\r\nThe latest standard declares the precedence of Max-Age over Expires, which makes the latter unnecessary. Meanwhile, the framework provides it to support older clients. Unfortunately, negative max-ages are violating the older RFCs, which are the ones older clients are likely to support. Which spoils the whole idea.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the hardcoded one-day offset seems very dangerous: cookie cancellation must not depend on the client's local time settings.\r\n\r\nI found out that it's the #6890, where this workaround-ish behavior was introduced instead of a proper fix in [ServerCookieEncoder.java:85][5].\r\n\r\n[5]: https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/0f18b8debd5d4c12948db735567491b199eb1bb2/framework/src/play/src/main/java/play/core/cookie/encoding/ServerCookieEncoder.java#L85\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8326","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8326/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8326/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8326/events","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/8326","id":310465584,"number":8326,"title":"Evolutions treat PLPGSQL dolar sign as comment","user":{"login":"eximius313","id":5578017,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5578017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eximius313","html_url":"https://github.com/eximius313","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eximius313/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eximius313/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eximius313/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eximius313/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eximius313/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eximius313/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eximius313/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eximius313/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eximius313/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-04-02T11:47:37Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T23:13:22Z","closed_at":"2018-04-02T23:13:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Play Version (2.5.x / etc)\r\n2.6.11\r\n\r\n### API (Scala / Java / Neither / Both)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Operating System (Ubuntu 15.10 / MacOS 10.10 / Windows 10)\r\nWindows 7\r\n\r\n### JDK (Oracle 1.8.0_72, OpenJDK 1.8.x, Azul Zing)\r\nJDK 9.0.4\r\n\r\n### Library Dependencies\r\nPostgres 9.3.6\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nI can use PLPGSQL in evolution script\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nPlay throws:\r\n```\r\nWe got the following error: Unterminated dollar quote started at position 60 in SQL CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION do_something() RETURNS trigger AS $$ BEGIN PERFORM some_action(OLD.my_id); RETURN OLD; END.

I am using linkedhashmap with some non contiguous key values like 1,2,7,22,14 as key and some string as values.

But when i hit the route in my browser or using postman the map is getting sorted by ids. And it will like 1,2,4,7,14,22. Please help me to resolve this.

CSP filter should generate a nonce and attach it as an attribute to the `RequestHeader`. This feature would be also useful when used standalone. When it comes to the CSP policy, it should replace some special token like `@nonce@` to the actual nonce value. This token may be specified as regexp like `'nonce-[^']+'`, so any nonce field in CSP would be transformed to a valid nonce.\r\n>\r\n> 2. Error template should include nonce extracted from the request in all inline content, so it will pass CSP filter.\r\n\r\nThis would provide a simple way for users and libraries to integrate with Play's CSP header. For example, the play-swagger project (see [issue](https://github.com/iheartradio/play-swagger/issues/174)) could make use of the nonce for inline elements.","score":1.0}]}
