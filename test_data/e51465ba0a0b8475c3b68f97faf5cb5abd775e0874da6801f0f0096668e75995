is to remove the hassle of domain mapping on non-dev profile if its only one domain is used or configured.\r\n\r\nI'm adding this enhancement due to this question on Gitter

subdomain implementation. Basically it does routing based on incoming request `host` & `port no`. So it requires to provide information about host  & port no is being  used on non-dev profile.\r\n\r\n**For e.g.:** Following is aahframework.org and docs.aahframework.org domain mappings on `prod` profile.\r\n\r\n```\r\nroutes {\r\n  domains {\r\n    aahframework {\r\n      host = \"aahframework.org\"\r\n      port = \"443\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    docs_aahframework {\r\n      host = \"docs.aahframework.org\"\r\n      port = \"443\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Outcome of this Enhancement**\r\nIf its only one domain is used or configured. aah router recognizes and will treats it as `*`.
