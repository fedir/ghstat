goal is to bring configurable option of Authorization at domain and route level for roles and permission.\r\n\r\n**How is authorization (Roles and Permission) check happening now?**\r\n\r\nCurrently, aah user have to use Controller interceptors (Before or Before&lt;Action> based on scenario) to do roles and permission check.\r\n\r\n**What are the benefits of having this configurable option at each route level?**\r\n\r\n* aah performs the `Authorization` per configured roles and permission against logged in `Subject` for incoming request\r\n    - If authorization is `success `then request would proceed as normal\r\n    - If authorization is `failed ` then aah calls `error handling` flow\r\n    - If authorization check is not configured then request would proceed to controller action\r\n* Also you have existing flexibility and control to do you own Authorization\r\n\r\n#### Configuration Syntax\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Authorization (access rights/privileges)\r\n# \r\n# Note: It is not evaluated, if `<route>.auth` attribute is `anonymous`.\r\nauthorization {\r\n  # Satisfy value is used to evaluate the result of `roles` and `permissions` attribute.\r\n  #\r\n  # Possible values are \r\n  #   - `either` => either roles or permissions should satisfy for Subject\r\n  #   - `both`   => both roles and permissions should satisfy for Subject\r\n  #\r\n  # Default value is `either`.\r\n  satisfy = \"either\"\r\n\r\n  # Roles (Optional config)\r\n  # Result of role function is evaluated as AND.\r\n  #\r\n  # Supported functions are `hasrole`, `hasanyrole`, `hasallroles`.\r\n  # Roles are comma(,) separated values.\r\n  roles = [\r\n    \"hasrole(manager)\",\r\n    \"hasanyrole(role1, role2, role3)\"\r\n  ]\r\n\r\n  # Permissions (Optional config)\r\n  # Doc: https://docs.aahframework.org/security-permissions.html\r\n  #\r\n  # Result of permission function is evaluated as AND.\r\n  #\r\n  # Supported functions are `ispermitted`, `ispermittedall`.\r\n  # Permissions are pipe(|) separated values.\r\n  permissions = [\r\n    \"ispermitted(newsletter:read,write)\",\r\n    \"ispermittedall(newsletter:read,write | newsletter:12345)\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Where to configure Authorization ?\r\n\r\nAuthorization configuration defined in `routes.conf`. \r\n\r\n* Child Route inherits parent `authorization { ... }` config if not defined.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation\r\n- [x]
