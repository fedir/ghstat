is not going to override the default themselves, but instead expect applications using Tornado to override the default. In other words, Tornado expects Python-Livereload to set this itself.\r\n\r\nOf course users of Python-Livereload who are calling the lib programmatically through Python code can just do the override themselves. However, anyone using the command line tool will need Python-Livereload to address this for them. Therefore, my question is: will Python-Livereload be addressing this for all users or only the command line tool?

THE FOLLOWING FIRST:\r\n\r\nIf not already done, please read the the Contribution Guidelines that\r\nare linked to the right under \"Helpful resources\" > \"Contributing\".\r\n\r\nAlso read the FAQ: https://faq.octoprint.org\r\n\r\nThis is a bug and feature tracker, please only use it to report bugs\r\nor request features within OctoPrint (not OctoPi, not any OctoPrint\r\nplugins and not unofficial OctoPrint versions).\r\n\r\nDo not seek support here (\"I need help with ...\", \"I have a\r\nquestion ...\"), that belongs on the community forum at \r\ncommunity.octoprint.org, NOT here.\r\n\r\nMark requests with a \"[Request]\" prefix in the title please. For bug\r\nreports fully fill out the bug reporting template (if you don't know\r\nwhere to find some information - it's all described in the Contribution\r\nGuidelines linked up there in the big yellow box).\r\n\r\nWhen reporting a bug do NOT delete ANY lines from the template.\r\n\r\nMake sure any bug you want to report is still present with the CURRENT\r\nOctoPrint version and that it does not vanish when you start OctoPrint\r\nin safe mode - how to do that is also explained in the Contribution\r\nGuidelines linked up there in the big yellow box.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What were you doing?\r\n\r\nWhen using the octopod iPhone app where the URL to connect to the octoprint server has a different case than the hostname configured on the machine (an octopi in this case), the octopod client gets a \"Not refreshing\" error and the octoprint repeatedly logs show:\r\n\r\n    2020-04-13 11:56:36,579 - tornado.access - WARNING - 403 GET /sockjs/websocket (::ffff:192.168.1.1) 1.56ms\r\n\r\n(After much trial and error) I found that the hostname on the machine is configured as \"3dprinterpi.example.com\" (it's not really example.com, but you get the picture.  The important info is the hostname is all lowercase). In my octopod printer config, i had the hostname set as \"http://3dPrinterPi.example.com\". This seems to cause the 403 errors. If I change the hostname to \"http://3dprinterpi.example.com\", it works.\r\n\r\nI reported this to Octopod (https://github.com/gdombiak/OctoPod/issues/298), but it seems this might a tornado issue or how octoprint is using tornado.  \r\n\r\nThis is from @gdombiak:\r\n\r\n> TL;DR: According to the specification, clients (like OctoPod) should be able to send uppercase/lowercase/any mix and things should still work. This could be a Tornado issue or maybe some validation done by OctoPrint? I never looked at that part of OctoPrint's code to know what is going on.\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nPlease be as specific as possible here. The maintainers will need to\r\nreproduce your issue in order to fix it and that is not possible if they\r\ndon't know what you did to get it to happen in the first place.\r\n\r\nIdeally provide exact steps to follow in order to reproduce your problem:\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\n* Configure octopod client to use a URL where the case is different than the case defined on the octoprint server.\r\n* Try to connect to the octoprint server using the Octopod client.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you encountered a problem with specific files of any sorts, make sure\r\nto also include a link to a file with which to reproduce the problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nthe octopod client should function normally (get and set data, control the printer, etc).\r\n\r\n#### What happened instead?\r\n\r\nThe octopod client gets the initial data, but all subsequent websocket requests get a 403 error. The octopod client no longer gets any data. \r\n\r\n#### Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode?\r\n\r\nI haven't tried. It's running a 8 hour print.  This likely has nothing to do with safe mode.  But I'll try when it's done and update this issue.\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nTest if you can reproduce your problem in safe mode. You can find information\r\non how to enable safe mode in the Contribution Guidelines.\r\n\r\nIf you can't reproduce in safe mode, this is a bug with one of your\r\ninstalled third party plugins.
