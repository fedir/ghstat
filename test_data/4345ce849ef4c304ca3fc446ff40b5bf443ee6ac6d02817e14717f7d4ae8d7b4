whitelist of available logical operators and mySQL functions that we can use out-of-the-box with October's filter list widgets in the doc's.\r\n\r\n(hope I make sense in this request).\r\n\r\nOr if you could point us in the direction to find the information, then we will add it to the October website doc's (no such thing as a free lunch).","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/38154","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/38154/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/38154/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/38154/events","html_url":"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/38154","id":698886173,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2OTg4ODYxNzM=","number":38154,"title":"[Yaml]

 \r\n\r\nOctober CMS uses the `symfony/yaml` component to parse the changelog of a plugin.\r\n\r\nIn one of our plugins, we have used a `:` in an unquoted string: https://github.com/OFFLINE-GmbH/oc-mall-plugin/pull/572/files\r\n\r\nThis has been working fine for months, but a few days ago, this line started being parsed as an object/array, instead of a simple string. This caused the update routine of the plugin to break.\r\n\r\nDowngrading `symfony/yaml` from version `3.4.44` to `3.4.43` made the issue disappear. It looks like this change is causing the issue: https://github.com/symfony/yaml/commit/12473febc5f2b19756339922e55035f52558d7bb\r\n\r\nTo be clear: I am aware that the `:` inside the unquoted string was a mistake to begin with. But this change feels like a breaking change that should not have been included in a patch version.\r\n\r\nLooking closer at this issue, I found out that the real problem is the `!!!` start of the line, which October uses to mark an update the user has to manually confirm. It looks like this is parsed as a [\"non-specific tag\"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9664113/what-does-a-single-exclamation-mark-do-in-yaml).\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**  \r\n\r\nThe following `ParserTest` passed in `3.4.43` but fails in `3.4.44`:\r\n\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass ParserTest extends TestCase\r\n{\r\n    // ...\r\n    public function testStringWithColonAndExclamationMarks()\r\n    {\r\n        $yaml = <<<YAML\r\n1.2.3:\r\n    - !!! Link to website: https://google.com\r\nYAML;\r\n\r\n        $this->assertSame(['1.2.3' => ['!!! Link to website: https://google.com']], $this->parser->parse($yaml));\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**  \r\n\r\nThe culprit of this issue is the [`'!' === $values['value'][0]`](https://github.com/symfony/yaml/commit/12473febc5f2b19756339922e55035f52558d7bb#diff-037865b8555f7db5ac9338cfb5be7466R236) line in the modified if statement. Using an unquoted `!!!` seems to be a bad idea in the first place so I wonder if you even want to do something about this problem.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I should provide a PR.\r\n\r\nRefs

group filter dosen't work when the Model table defined in `modelClass` have to many row. \r\n\r\nFor big application, like a shop by example, it's important to can filter fields with a model that have many records. Example : filter all commands by client from a list of 5000 clients.\r\n\r\n##### Actual behavior\r\n1. When open the filter the system do a query for load all records (`select * from table;`) and display them in the list. This behavior is very nice when you have only few items but query a big tables is a big time consumer\r\n2. When the filter is valided, all records are send in the POST request to the server : when you have several thousand of records you have many chances to exceed the PHP max_input_vars limit.\r\n\r\n##### Expected behavior\r\n1. Two scope option for can choose **a limit** and an other for can completly **disable** the initial dropdown (before starting to search) can be very useful and lets the AJAX autocomplete do her job (still with a limit).\r\n2. Only send active records to the server on the POST request don't think that is useful to have available fields provided here.\r\n\r\n##### Reproduce steps\r\n1.
