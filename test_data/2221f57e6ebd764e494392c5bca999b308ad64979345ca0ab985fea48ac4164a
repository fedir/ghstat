Almost.\n\nAs someone who is desperately looking for a lightweight alternative to Rails, I first turned to Sinatra. Very capable little framework with a huge community. There was just one problem - I can't stand the controllers and all those route blocks. I wanted a controller that was more OO, more Rubyish in the purest sense. This is where Magnus struck a chord with me.\n\nHe went on to gush about Camping's small and devoted community:\n\n```\nCamping definitely has a great community too. Size doesn't always matter. Because there are so few users, it means every single issue gets full attention.\n```\n\nThis is where he started to lose me. For starters you guys have open issues here from two years ago - many of them trailing off with unanswered questions. Secondly, yall are using the shittiest mailing list in the history of software. I mean seriously.. rubyforge mailman? Are we in the 21st century yet? I can't browse the archives without wanting to rip my eyeballs out with rusty pliers. Even google groups are a step up (and that's saying a lot).\n\nAnother huge weakness is public relations. It's great that Camping is trying to be different and goes against the grain of the mainstream. But I think this idea has been taken too far. There simply is not enough press or engagement to really expand its sphere of influence in a meaningful way. No announcements of major updates. No blog posts. Either you're in the know, or.. fuck you. It's bad enough the name of the framework is common and hard to google, but this bad bit of SEO is exacerbated by a prevailing recluse mentality.\n\nAnd it's a damn shame because this is a great little framework! With very few exceptions (exception handling being one of them) it got so many things right. I suppose that is why I'm even bothering to write this issue. Maybe it will light a fire under someone's ass to remedy the situation. Given the track record, I am not betting the farm on it though.\n\nI do wish you guys the best of luck with this project, and hope that it will someday get the attention it deserves.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/camping/camping/issues/88","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/camping/camping","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/camping/camping/issues/88/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/camping/camping/issues/88/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/camping/camping/issues/88/events","html_url":"https://github.com/camping/camping/issues/88","id":25057699,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNTA1NzY5OQ==","number":88,"title":"Could

But it wasn't a smooth or noob friendly installation.  \n\nI'm on Linux Mint 14.  I think my installation of ruby happened via RVM right on my non-super user account.  When I tried to do 'camping nuts.rb' it threw up a huge error/ stack trace in my web browser where it was telling me reload.rb (or something like that) was unable to locate a file.  \n\nUpon troubleshooting the issue, I noticed on the camping.io page it mentions \" (if you’re on Linux/OS X you might run it as root)\" with regard to the gem installations.  That warning is relevant but I don't see it on the github readme, so maybe that should get added in.  Also to fix my problem was kind of ridiculous because I had to su to root, and then it turned out 'ruby wasn't installed' so I installed RVM, messed around with gksu gnome-terminal and set that terminal to be a login shell and all that.  Things eventually worked out for me.  But I think we can do better.  \n\nIf possible, I think the gem should install smoothly from a non-root account.  If that's not possible, I think it would be nice to throw some warnings that it needs root and will likely need to be reinstalled with sudo (and if you get a message saying \"gem:  command not found\" then you need to install ruby as root too).

How can I access the redirect method from my base class?\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/camping/camping/issues/28","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/camping/camping","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/camping/camping/issues/28/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/camping/camping/issues/28/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/camping/camping/issues/28/events","html_url":"https://github.com/camping/camping/issues/28","id":265146,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNjUxNDY=","number":28,"title":"ActiveRecord Multipul Inserts","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2010-07-31T04:14:09Z","updated_at":"2010-07-31T17:19:41Z","closed_at":"2010-07-31T17:19:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm new to ruby so excuse me if this is an error on my part.\n\nIf I try to create 2 different objects with 2 different models it seems like only the first item is validating.\n\nHeres is the code from my controller:\n\n```\nunless @company = Company.create(\n  :name => @input.name,\n  :sub_domain => @input.sub_domain)\n\n  unless @user.User.create(\n    :company_id => @company.id,\n    :first_name => @input.first_name,\n    :last_name => @input.last_name,\n    :email => @input.email,\n    :password => @input.password)\n    return redirect Login\n  end\nend\n\n@errors = @company.errors.full_messages | @user.errors.full_messages\nrender :register\n```\n\nHere is my model:\n\n```\nclass Company < Base\n  validates_presence_of :name\n  validates_presence_of :sub_domain\n  validates_uniqueness_of :sub_domain\nend\n\nclass User < Base\n  validates_presence_of :first_name\n  validates_presence_of :last_name\n  validates_presence_of :email\n  validates_presence_of :password\n  validates_uniqueness_of :email\nend\n```\n\nThe validation only seems to work on the company model. once the validation passes for the company it redirects and doesn't validate or save the user. Is this an issue with camping or am I doing something wrong?\n\n**Edit by judofyr:** I cleaned up the indentation of the code a bit.
