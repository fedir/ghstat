has been a recurring topic for quite some time, and we've talked about this yesterday on IRC again. There are two logging scopes in Mojolicious, the first is operations that can be mapped to a request/response, and the second is everything outside the request/response cycle (such as a timer defined in the `startup` method).\r\n\r\nFor this feature we only care about the first case, any operation that can be mapped to the request/response cycle.\r\n```perl\r\nget '/' => sub ($c) {\r\n  $c->log->debug('Some log message with request id!');\r\n  $c->render(text => 'Hello Mojo!');\r\n};\r\n```\r\nA log message created inside an action is the simplest case. In this context we want to get a log message that contains the request id (`$c->req->request_id`).\r\n```\r\n[2018-11-08 14:20:13.77168] [info] [1af234b] Some log message with request id!\r\n```\r\nBut we also want to allow models to generate log messages with request id. One possible solution for that would be to make `$c->log` a secondary log object that contains the request id, and that can be passed to model objects/methods.\r\n```perl\r\nget '/' => sub ($c) {\r\n  my $log = $c->log;\r\n  my $foo = $c->param('foo');\r\n  $c->some_model->create({foo => $foo}, $log);\r\n  $c->render(text => 'Hello Mojo!');\r\n};\r\n\r\n...\r\npackage MyApp::Model::SomeModel;\r\n\r\nsub create ($self, $values, $log) {\r\n  $self->do_stuff($values);\r\n  $log->debug('Another log message with request id!');\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\nOf course this also means the secondary log object would work for non-blocking operations started inside the request/response cycle.\r\n```perl\r\nget '/' => sub ($c) {\r\n  my $log = $c->log;\r\n  Mojo::IOLoop->timer(1 => sub {\r\n    $log->debug('Yet another log message with request id!');\r\n  });\r\n  $c->render(text => 'Hello Mojo!');\r\n};\r\n```\r\nLogging in models is a problem that most of us are facing in web applications at some point. And i think the framework should provide at least one reasonable solution out of the box.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mojolicious/mojo/issues/1250","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mojolicious/mojo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mojolicious/mojo/issues/1250/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mojolicious/mojo/issues/1250/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mojolicious/mojo/issues/1250/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo/issues/1250","id":349597806,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDk1OTc4MDY=","number":1250,"title":"Bring back stream classes","user":{"login":"kraih","id":30094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kraih","html_url":"https://github.com/kraih","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kraih/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kraih/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kraih/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kraih/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kraih/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kraih/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kraih/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kraih/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kraih/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":289647972,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODk2NDc5NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mojolicious/mojo/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"d4c5f9","default":true,"description":null},{"id":241525,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDE1MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mojolicious/mojo/labels/scheduled","name":"scheduled","color":"9332bc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-08-10T17:30:52Z","updated_at":"2019-06-15T21:27:27Z","closed_at":"2019-06-15T21:27:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"With Mojolicious 7.92 we unfortunately had to remove stream classes (https://github.com/kraih/mojo/commit/61f6cbf22c7bf8eb4787bd1014d91ee2416c73e7), since they were too unstable. But i think the feature is still very valuable and we should try to bring it back. \r\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems were race conditions during connection shutdown. These were extremely hard to track down because the stream classes had not been properly decoupled from the classes their code was extracted from (`Mojo::UserAgent` and `Mojo::Server::Daemon`). Therefore i believe that much more thought will have to be put into designing new stream class APIs.
