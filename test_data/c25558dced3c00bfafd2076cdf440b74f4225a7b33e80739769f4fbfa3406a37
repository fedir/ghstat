have noticed something while using Padrino (currently I am using 0.10.5).\n\nFirst of all, it a bit long to start, and this is not such a problem. I (re)start very seldom.  But the problem comes when I change a helper file or controller file. In this case I am waiting between 30 seconds  to 2 minutes sometimes for the app to reload. \n\nWhat makes this even stranger, is that when I do not change a file that is directly tied to the framework, such as the models, or the views (mine are datamapper and haml respectively), then I am only waiting for maybe 5 seconds for the reload to happen. \n\nAs you can imagine, 30 seconds here, and 1 minute there, soon adds up and I think I have easily spent a couple of hours in a few weeks just waiting for padrino to reload. \n\nIs there anything that I could check that could be causing it to take so long to do the reloads? I have checked the logs, and even started padrino with strace, but I wasn't able to see what was causing the slowness.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/isaacs/github/issues/1492","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/isaacs/github","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/isaacs/github/issues/1492/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/isaacs/github/issues/1492/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/isaacs/github/issues/1492/events","html_url":"https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1492","id":411555376,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTE1NTUzNzY=","number":1492,"title":"GitHub

Now Pardrino doesn't fall behind Sass and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) which have supported passing blocks to mixins since forever.\n\nUnfortunately, this won't work in Middleman. Middleman produces the following HTML:\n\n``` html\n    Yay, a codeblock!\n<h1>prefix</h1>\n<div class=\"haml-block\">\n  0\n</div>\n<h3>postfix</h3>\n```\n\n@ujifgc, a Padrino maintainer who was kind to implement this feature, supposes that the problem in Middleman might take place due to [this](https://github.com/middleman/middleman/blob/master/middleman-core/lib/middleman-more/core_extensions/default_helpers.rb#L74) monkey patch. He suggests that we should:\n1. determine why this monkey patch is there in the first place and\n2. either get rid of it or modify it to support modern Padrino.\n\nThe reason for the issue may hide elsewhere though.\n\nHere's a sandbox project that can be used to test the issue quickly: https://github.com/lolmaus/middleman-padrino-test-partial-block\n\nPS Yes, i know that Padrino/Middleman partials can accept code blocks by processing them through `capture_html`, assigning the result to variables and passing the variables to partials. But this is just ugly. Partials should be able to accept code blocks naturally, just like mixins in Sass and Jade. Padrino already made that happen. Please make Middleman compatible.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tendrl/documentation/issues/13","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tendrl/documentation","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tendrl/documentation/issues/13/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tendrl/documentation/issues/13/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tendrl/documentation/issues/13/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Tendrl/documentation/issues/13","id":177431977,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNzc0MzE5Nzc=","number":13,"title":"Tendrl App","user":{"login":"nthomas-redhat","id":6671718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzE3MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6671718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nthomas-redhat","html_url":"https://github.com/nthomas-redhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nthomas-redhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nthomas-redhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nthomas-redhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nthomas-redhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nthomas-redhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nthomas-redhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nthomas-redhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nthomas-redhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nthomas-redhat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-09-16T13:56:47Z","updated_at":"2018-01-23T08:08:34Z","closed_at":"2018-01-23T08:08:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"1.

everyone,\n\nwhen working on the SFML port and now on the CEGUI 0.8 port, I have come over numerous problems of the code in terms of\n- Bad code design (no `private` or `protected`, for example — violations of the secrecy principle everywhere!)\n- Bad variable naming (numerous member variables have no prefix; variable names are often nondescriptive or even misleading)\n- No documentation (the comments often only repeat what the code says anywhere, and do not contain any reasoning or usage documentation; exceptions are the comments that we as the TSC team added to our legacy codebase)\n- No use of exceptions, except where we introduced it slightly\n- No use of references, except where we introduced it silghtly\n- No use of modern C++(11) in general. The legacy codebase is, except for parts we modified, in the state of C++ 10 years ago.\n- The menu system is a mess.\n- Global variables everywhere! (and of course not obviously named as global variables)\n\nI am sure the list can be continued. I therefore make the suggestion the rewrite large parts of the game from scratch. The code for the enemies can most likely be kept in large places, but everything else is up for new. As we have more or less discussed redoing many parts of the game in our cycle anyway, I think we should be honest and think about whether starting from a blank slate and with a clean architecture is going to give us less work then trying to fit our ideas of good code architecture into the legacy code base we have. For instance, we have discussed:\n- Scene architecture. This will cause a rewrite of a very large part of the codebase.\n- Physics systems.\n- Lighting systems.\n- Upgrading OpenGL.\n- Energy system.\n- Game mechanics.\n- Numerous issues tagged with \"legacy code\" on this tracker.\n\nIf all of these will be implemented, this will be a rewrite of most of TSC anyway. So we can also just start from scratch. Of, course **graphics, music, etc would be kept!** There is no need to remove that!\n\nI do not mean to start this right now. I will complete the CEGUI 0.8 porting, and we will see a number of releases of the 2.x series. I suggest to consider the rewrite for a 3.x series.\n\nA rewrite will allow us to architect the codebase the way we want it to have, without having to worry about how to fit things into this mess we have inherited. We can completely redo our dependency list, and we will be able to go easier make the changes listed above. Instead of a step-by-step upgrade causing bugs and misbehaviours of the rest of the legacy we have, we can directly do it correctly. As a side effect, we could rethink legal aspects of the codebase if we don’t have any lines left from original SMC. That however is stuff for a new issue in case we decide to go for the rewrite. Even more, if anyone here feels unsatisfied with C++, we could consider a different programming language. Let me however make clear that I am very reluctant to that as I’m pretty happy with C++.\n\nIf we get time, I’d like to discuss this a little in the upcoming General Discussion, but I repeat that this is a midterm proposal and nothing for the next release or even the next number of releases. It is not in a votable state. It is an open discussion that we should have here.\n\nThis ticket is mainly targetted at the programmers involved into TSC. @Luiji, @brianvanderburg2, @lambda-11235, @datahead8888, what do you think of this? I am sure everyone of you has stood before the legacy code and thought more than once “what a mess it is!”. In my opinion, trying to reform the large legacy codebase with all its flaws is not worth it. Restarting is better and quicker.\n\nValete,\nQuintus\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/2125","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/padrino/padrino-framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/2125/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/2125/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/2125/events","html_url":"https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/2125","id":213320566,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMTMzMjA1NjY=","number":2125,"title":"catching `LoadError` when loading `database.rb` leads to confusing errors","user":{"login":"fnordfish","id":12839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish","html_url":"https://github.com/fnordfish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":22570558,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjU3MDU1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/padrino/padrino-framework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"e10c02","default":true,"description":null},{"id":24599835,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU5OTgzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/padrino/padrino-framework/labels/reloader","name":"reloader","color":"0b02e1","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-03-10T11:47:14Z","updated_at":"2017-03-13T09:24:34Z","closed_at":"2017-03-13T09:24:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I've run into an interesting to track down error using padrino 0.13.3.3 and sequel 4.44.0 (also see jeremyevans/sequel#1317)\r\n\r\nWhen a `LoadError` is raised inside `database.rb` it is going to get \"swallowed\" which leads to errors way later in the application.\r\n\r\nIn my particular case a `LoadError` was raised before the database connection could be established.
