The indentation will be stripped\n  from all lines in the heredoc/nowdoc string.\n\nLexing of heredoc strings performs a scan-ahead to determine the\nindentation of the ending label, so that the correct amount of\nindentation can be removed when calculting the semantic values for\nuse by the parser. This makes the implementation quite a bit more\ncomplicated than we would like
