Therefore, I'm looking for ways to convert my Unfiltered plans/filters to servlets. That is my main question. What does it amount to to wrap/convert Unfiltered filters to servlets?\n\nA sidelines question would be, why filters instead of servlets, or rather, why only filters? According to the servlet specification (to my understanding), servlets, as opposed to filters, are meant to be the primary servers of content.
