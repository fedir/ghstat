In this case all component should be defined as a method in module!  \r\n\r\nLIke I said I could be wrong about this, as some of the code has gotten simplified and cleaned up, but bottom line simply adding a class method `[]` would involve much less meta programming, and I am guessing would be faster, etc.\r\n\r\nI think its also just less strange.

ideal would be to access Rails route helpers verbatim just as you would in backend views or helpers. But the routing code is pretty tangled so I think it won't be possible to run it directly on the frontend without effort.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to add .erb to component files and interpolate the route on the backend with static placeholder values, then gsub in real values on the frontend.\r\n\r\nFirst, make it easier to access route helpers:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# config/initializers/routes.rb\r\nclass Routes\r\n  include Singleton\r\n  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers\r\n\r\n  def self.method_missing(name, *args, &block)\r\n    if instance.respond_to?(name)\r\n      instance.send(name, *args, &block)\r\n    else\r\n      super\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def self.respond_to_missing?(name, include_all = false)\r\n    instance.respond_to?(name, include_all)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in your [ApplicationComponent](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/issues/227) add this helper to do the substitution:\r\n```ruby\r\nclass ApplicationComponent < Hyperloop::Component\r\n  def rails_route(route, *positional, **named)\r\n    route = route.split(\"/\").reverse.join(\"/\")\r\n    positional.each_with_index do |replacement, i|\r\n      route = route.sub(i.to_s, replacement.to_s)\r\n    end\r\n    named.each do |key, replacement|\r\n      route = route.sub(key.to_s, replacement.to_s)\r\n    end\r\n    \"/\" + route.split(\"/\").reverse.join(\"/\")\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally use the mechanism in your components:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass CommentLink < ApplicationComponent\r\n  param :comment\r\n\r\n  render do\r\n    A(href: rails_route(\r\n      \"<%= Routes.user_posts_comments_path(0, 1, \"xyz\") %>\", \r\n      User.current.id, params.comment.post.id, xyz: params.comment.id\r\n    )) { \"View Comment\" }\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing positional arguments is the easiest, but if your route contains numbers it won't work so explicitly name your arguments with placeholders that won't clash. The above example shows both.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/issues/224","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/issues/224/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/issues/224/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/issues/224/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/issues/224","id":261236942,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNjEyMzY5NDI=","number":224,"title":"http://ruby-hyperloop.io/

I've tried following the [`README.md`](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/blob/master/README.md) but it results in a runtime error (in the browser console): `every: undefined method `every' for main`\r\n\r\nI've also tried to follow the two links in the `README.md` given for gem installation rather than using `reactrb-express` (http://ruby-hyperloop.io/get_started/, http://ruby-hyperloop.io/installation/) but the first is specifically for `reactrb-express` and the second is for integration with `Rails`.\r\n\r\nI'm developing a static site and followed `OpalRB`'s instructions [here](http://opalrb.org/docs/guides/v0.10.3/static_applications.html) but I'm now stuck trying to figure out which gems need to be installed and what api the classes or modules are providing. It's especially confusing since there aren't any examples with `require` statements in them.\r\n\r\nFrom reading various reference pages (some older), I believe I need the following:\r\n\r\n**Gemfile**\r\n```\r\nsource 'https://rubygems.org'\r\n\r\ngem 'hyper-react'\r\ngem 'opal'\r\ngem 'opal-browser'\r\ngem 'opal-jquery'\r\ngem 'opal-rspec'\r\ngem 'rake'\r\ngem 'rubocop'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Rakefile**\r\n```\r\nrequire 'bundler'\r\nBundler.require\r\n\r\nOpal.append_path(File.expand_path('../app', __FILE__))\r\n\r\nrequire 'opal'\r\nrequire 'opal/rspec/rake_task'\r\n\r\ndesc 'Compile app/application.rb to build.js'\r\ntask :build do\r\n  File.binwrite('build.js', Opal::Builder.build('application').to_s)\r\nend\r\n\r\nOpal::RSpec::RakeTask.new do |_, task|\r\n  task.runner = :node\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n**app/application.rb**\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'opal'\r\nrequire 'browser'\r\nrequire 'opal-jquery'\r\nrequire 'react/react-source'\r\nrequire 'hyper-react'\r\n\r\nclass HelloWorld < React::Component::Base\r\n  param :time, type: Time\r\n  render do\r\n    p do\r\n      span { \"Hello, \" }\r\n      input(type: :text, placeholder: \"Your Name Here\")\r\n      span { \"!

`reactrb-express` and it was nice to not have to compile, but I didn't see how I could load other libraries via a `Gemfile` or make tests for the components via `opal-rspec`.\r\n\r\nIf anyone could point me in the right direction where there's solid instructional material to stand up a server-less application with `hyper-react`, I'd really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThank

Unless you are customizing how react source is loaded, the current implementation will always use the development build. This is really bad, since the development build is slow and takes more size in final build.\r\n\r\nSo, the solution is introducing `React::Config`, an universal config for HyperReact. Currently, it only provide `React::Config.config[:environment]` which by default depending on the value of `RACK_ENV` (already set by Rails , so it should work out of box if you are using Rails) \r\n\r\nThe same config will be serialized and picked up at runtime to disable dev-only warning. To be noticed, the config is readonly in browser context. \r\n\r\nYou can set the environment config yourself as following or simply provide `RACK_ENV`. \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nReact::Config.environment = 'production'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe work on this is tracked on #203 \r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/issues/201","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/issues/201/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/issues/201/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/issues/201/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-react/issues/201","id":199329762,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxOTkzMjk3NjI=","number":201,"title":"Drop ruby 1.9.3 support","user":{"login":"zetachang","id":839973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTk3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/839973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zetachang","html_url":"https://github.com/zetachang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zetachang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zetachang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zetachang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zetachang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zetachang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zetachang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zetachang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zetachang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zetachang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-01-07T01:21:31Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T17:09:47Z","closed_at":"2018-01-22T17:09:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Given that \r\n* Opal is already depending on ruby version `>= 2.0` on master (https://github.com/opal/opal/commit/5990ac3b463ec6b58cadb3f03f0d35933653bb52)\r\n* Support for ruby 1.9.3 has already ended about 1 year. https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/02/23/support-for-ruby-1-9-3-has-ended/\r\n\r\nSo in the next release of hyper-react, it will require ruby `>= 2.0`.
