CakePHP 3.9.3.\r\nThe instance of `CsrfProtectionMiddleware` is stored in the route cache : `tmp/cache/myapp_cake_routes_route_collection` by default. \r\n\r\nIf the instance of the middleware is cached by CakePHP 3.9.2 or earlier, the instance does not have `samesite` configuration. And, it seems that the constructor function of the cached class is not called when the cache is used. So, after upgrading to 3.9.3, `invoke()` method emits the notice log.\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/74f60e2e1f15c8fd27653db2ee835d426b59ee83/src/Http/Middleware/CsrfProtectionMiddleware.php#L210\r\n\r\nI guess 4.x version has the same issue.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nThe issue can be resolved by removing the route cache file when upgrading.\r\nI was not doing so (my deploy script deletes only `models` & `persistent` cache), and I'm afraid that many application developers will see the same issue.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14978","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14978/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14978/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14978/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14978","id":703757305,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MDM3NTczMDU=","number":14978,"title":"Hash::reduce","user":{"login":"nachitox","id":1167303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjczMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1167303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nachitox","html_url":"https://github.com/nachitox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nachitox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nachitox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nachitox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nachitox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nachitox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nachitox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nachitox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nachitox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nachitox/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":60600135,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MDYwMDEzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/labels/support","name":"support","color":"207de5","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/milestones/224","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/milestone/224","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/milestones/224/labels","id":5369883,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTM2OTg4Mw==","number":224,"title":"4.2.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":31,"closed_issues":113,"state":"open","created_at":"2020-05-01T01:23:28Z","updated_at":"2020-11-14T20:11:23Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-09-17T17:00:04Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T02:19:17Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T02:19:17Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/Utility/Hash.php#L920\r\nhttps://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-reduce.php\r\n\r\nIf initial is not set, the function returns NULL, so Hash::reduce() will always return NULL, right?","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
