duplicated \"unresolved inter-package jump\" errors\n\nThis is extension to https://golang.org/cl/113955 that handled\nduplicated \"unresolved relocation\" errors.\n\nFor platforms with trampoline

This breaks TestUndefinedRelocErrors test\non these platforms.\n\nProposed fix:\n\n\t1. Changes error text to be identical to normal undefined reloc.\n\t   If relocation is undefined, jump to it will be unresolved\n\t   as well.\n\n\t2. Introduces a map that can be used by all sites that\n\t   handle this kind of errors which makes it easier\n\t   to report such errors exactly once.\n\nErrors on ppc64 before this change (note first 4

are emulated using spinlocks. However,\nthe sigprof handling code expects to be able to perform\n64-bit atomic operations in signal handlers. Spinning on an\nacquired spinlock in a signal handler leads to a livelock.\nThis is issue #20146.\n\nThe original fix for #20146 did not include arm in\nthe list of architectures that need to work around portability\nissues in the sigprof handler code. The unit test designed to\ncatch this issue does not fail on arm builds because arm uses\nstriped spinlocks, and thus the livelock takes many minutes\nto reproduce. This is issue #24260. (This patch doesn't completely\nfix #24260 on go1.10.2 due to issue #25785, which is probably\nrelated to the arm cas kernel helpers. Those have been removed\nat tip.)\n\nWith this patch applied, I was able to run the reproducer for\nissue #24260 for more than 90 minutes without reproducing the\nlivelock. Without this patch, the livelock took as little as\n8 minutes to reproduce.\n\nFixes #20146\nUpdates #24260\n\nChange-Id: I64bf53a14d53c4932367d919ac55e17c99d87484\nReviewed-on: https://go-review.googlesource.com/117057\nRun-TryBot: Philip Hofer <phofer@umich.edu>\nTryBot-Result: Gobot Gobot <gobot@golang.org>\nReviewed-by: Brad Fitzpatrick <bradfitz@golang.org>\nReviewed-by: Cherry Zhang <cherryyz@google.com>","tree":{"sha":"452a78a78444724166ed43e4f59828a23bbb2387","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/git/trees/452a78a78444724166ed43e4f59828a23bbb2387"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/git/commits/afae876b3189711c49f9d2cb197081f41c9f3979","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/commits/afae876b3189711c49f9d2cb197081f41c9f3979","html_url":"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/afae876b3189711c49f9d2cb197081f41c9f3979","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/commits/afae876b3189711c49f9d2cb197081f41c9f3979/comments","author":{"login":"philhofer","id":2940902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDA5MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2940902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philhofer","html_url":"https://github.com/philhofer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philhofer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philhofer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philhofer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philhofer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philhofer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philhofer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philhofer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philhofer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philhofer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"cherrymui","id":14119929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14119929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrymui","html_url":"https://github.com/cherrymui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrymui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrymui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrymui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrymui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrymui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrymui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrymui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrymui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrymui/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"abeac0912a037ac557861e6522204627585d6517","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/commits/abeac0912a037ac557861e6522204627585d6517","html_url":"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/abeac0912a037ac557861e6522204627585d6517"}]},{"sha":"abeac0912a037ac557861e6522204627585d6517","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjMwOTY5NTk6YWJlYWMwOTEyYTAzN2FjNTU3ODYxZTY1MjIyMDQ2Mjc1ODVkNjUxNw==","commit":{"author":{"name":"David du Colombier","email":"0intro@gmail.com","date":"2018-06-08T08:14:29Z"},"committer":{"name":"David du Colombier","email":"0intro@gmail.com","date":"2018-06-08T09:35:10Z"},"message":"cmd/cover: fix TestCoverHTML on Plan 9\n\nCL 116975 added TestCoverHTML.

All new code\n(except for the additional tests) is guarded by the useCycleMarking\n(internal) flag and thus can be disabled on short notice if it\nintroduced new problems. (The intent is to remove this flag shortly\nafter 1.11 is released.)\n\nThe test suite has been extended with various additional (and mostly\nesoteric) test cases which now correctly report cycles.

extra byte of randomness in some places.\n\nCode has ended up depending on things like RSA's key generation being\ndeterministic given a fixed random Reader. This was never guaranteed and\nwould prevent us from ever changing anything about it.\n\nThis change makes certain calls randomly (based on the internal\nfastrand) read an extra byte from the random Reader. This helps to\nensure that code does not depend on internal details.\n\nI've not added this call in the key generation of ECDSA and DSA because,\nin those cases, key generation is so obvious that it probably is\nacceptable to do the obvious thing and not worry about code that depends\non that.\n\nThis does not affect tests that use a Reader of constant bytes (e.g. a\nzeroReader) because shifting such a stream is a no-op. The stdlib uses\nthis internally (which is fine because it can be atomically updated if\nthe crypto libraries change).\n\nIt is possible that external tests could be doing the same and would\nthus break if we ever, say, tweaked the way RSA key generation worked.\nI feel that addressing that would be more effort than it's worth.\n\nFixes #21915\n\nChange-Id: I84cff2e249acc921ad6eb5527171e02e6d39c530\nReviewed-on: https://go-review.googlesource.com/64451\nReviewed-by: Brad Fitzpatrick <bradfitz@golang.org>\nRun-TryBot: Brad Fitzpatrick <bradfitz@golang.org>","tree":{"sha":"93fd7b86f497fbd87dd1cfbecb409454d3a8a456","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/git/trees/93fd7b86f497fbd87dd1cfbecb409454d3a8a456"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/git/commits/6269dcdc24d74379d8a609ce886149811020b2cc","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/commits/6269dcdc24d74379d8a609ce886149811020b2cc","html_url":"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/6269dcdc24d74379d8a609ce886149811020b2cc","comments_url":"https://api
