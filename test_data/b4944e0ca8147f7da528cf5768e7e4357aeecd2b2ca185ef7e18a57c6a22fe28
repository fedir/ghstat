lower OpConvert\n\nCurrently, each architecture lowers OpConvert to an arch-specific\nOpXXXconvert. This is silly because OpConvert means the same thing on\nall architectures and is logically a no-op that exists only to keep\ntrack of conversions to and from unsafe.Pointer. Furthermore, lowering\nit makes it harder to recognize in other analyses, particularly\nliveness analysis.\n\nThis CL eliminates the lowering of OpConvert, leaving it as the\ngeneric op until code generation time.\n\nThe main complexity here is that we still need to register-allocate\nOpConvert operations. Currently, each arch's lowered OpConvert\nspecifies all GP registers in its register mask. Ideally, OpConvert\nwouldn't affect value homing at all, and we could just copy the home\nof OpConvert's source, but this can potentially home an OpConvert in a\nLocalSlot, which neither regalloc nor stackalloc expect. Rather than\ntry to disentangle this assumption from regalloc and stackalloc, we\ncontinue to register-allocate OpConvert, but teach regalloc that\nOpConvert can be allocated to any allocatable GP register.\n\nFor #24543.\n\nChange-Id: I795a6aee5fd94d4444a7bafac3838a400c9f7bb6\nReviewed-on: https://go-review.googlesource.com/108496\nRun-TryBot: Austin Clements

generate load without DS relocation for go.string on ppc64le\n\nDue to some recent optimizations related to the compare\ninstruction, DS-form load instructions started to be used\nto load 8-byte go.strings. This can cause link time errors\nif the go.string is not aligned to 4 bytes.\n\nFor DS-form instructions, the value in the offset field must\nbe a multiple of 4. If the offset is known at the time the\nrules are processed, a DS-form load will not be chosen. But for\ngo.strings, the offset is not known at that time, but a\nrelocation is generated indicating that the linker should fill\nin the DS relocation. When the linker tries to fill in the\nrelocation, if the offset is not aligned properly, a link error\nwill occur.\n\nTo fix this, when loading a go.string using MOVDload, the full\naddress of the go.string is generated and loaded into the base\nregister. Then the go.string is loaded with a 0 offset field.\n\nAdded a testcase that reproduces this problem.\n\nFixes #24799\n\nChange-Id: I6a154e8e1cba64eae290be0fbcb608b75884ecdd\nReviewed-on:
