Any pointers in the result space must be zeroed, so we just\nzero the whole struct.\n\nHowever, C makes it surprisingly hard to robustly zero any struct\ntype. We had used a \"{0}\" initializer, which works in the vast\nmajority of cases, but fails if the type is empty or effectively\nempty.\n\nThis CL fixes this by changing how the cgo tool zero-initializes the\nargument struct to be more robust.\n\nFixes #42495.\n\nChange-Id: Id1749b9d751e59eb7a02a9d44fec0698a2bf63cd\nReviewed-on: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/269337\nTrust: Austin Clements <austin@google.com>\nRun-TryBot: Austin Clements <austin@google.com>\nTryBot-Result: Go Bot <gobot@golang.org>\nReviewed-by: Cherry Zhang <cherryyz@google.com>\nReviewed-by: Ian Lance Taylor <iant@golang.org>","tree":{"sha":"3b920dec7950a8e483710eeed9b84d06bcb125a1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/git/trees/3b920dec7950a8e483710eeed9b84d06bcb125a1"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/git/commits/f423d616b15302730c1b737a3b22afca315a7fbe","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/commits/f423d616b15302730c1b737a3b22afca315a7fbe","html_url":"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/f423d616b15302730c1b737a3b22afca315a7fbe","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/commits/f423d616b15302730c1b737a3b22afca315a7fbe/comments","author":{"login":"aclements","id":2688315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODgzMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2688315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements","html_url":"https://github.com/aclements","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"aclements","id":2688315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODgzMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2688315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements","html_url":"https://github.com/aclements","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclements/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"35455fff0ebb7dd1b8e698f245a823ef8c711ac9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/commits/35455fff0ebb7dd1b8e698f245a823ef8c711ac9","html_url":"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/35455fff0ebb7dd1b8e698f245a823ef8c711ac9"}]},{"sha":"35455fff0ebb7dd1b8e698f245a823ef8c711ac9","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjMwOTY5NTk6MzU0NTVmZmYwZWJiN2RkMWI4ZTY5OGYyNDVhODIzZWY4YzcxMWFjOQ==","commit":{"author":{"name":"Daniel S Fava","email":"danielsfava@gmail.com","date":"2020-11-12T16:25:47Z"},"committer":{"name":"Ian Lance Taylor","email":"iant@golang.org","date":"2020-11-13T15:00:23Z"},"message":"runtime: swap the order of raceacquire() and racerelease()\n\nIn chansend() and chanrecv() of chan.go, the order of calls to\nraceacquire() and racerelease() was swapped, which meant that the\ncode was not following the memory model \"by the letter of the law.\"\nSimilar for bufrecv and bufsend in select.go\n\nThe memory model says:\n\n- A send happens before the corresponding receive completes, and\n- the kth receive on a channel with capacity C happens before the\nk+C send on that channel completes.\n\nThe operative word here is \"completes.\"  For example, a sender obtains\nhappens-before information on completion of the send-operation, which\nmeans, after the sender has deposited its message onto the channel.\nSimilarly for receives.\n\nIf the order of raceacquire() and racerelease() is incorrect, the race\ndetector may fail to report some race conditions.\n\nThe fix is minimal from the point of view of Go.

From the\nthree https://build.golang.org/ logs, it looked like the logged\nerrors could be associated with threads dying, but proc reads\nwere, in some way, racing with their demise.\n\nExploring ways to increase thread demise, revealed that races\nof this type can happen on non-ppc64 systems, and that\nos.IsNotExist(err) was not a sufficient error condition test\nfor a thread's status file disappearing. This change includes a\nfix for that to.\n\nThe actual issue on linux-ppc64 appears to be tied to PID reaping\nand reuse latency on whatever the build test environment is for\nlinux-ppc64-buildlet. I suspect this can happen on any linux\nsystem, however, especially where the container has a limited PID\nrange.\n\nThe fix for this, limited to the test (the runtime syscall support\nis unchanged), is to confirm that the Pid for the interrogated\nthread's /proc/<TID>/status file confirms that it is still\nassociated with the test-process' PID.\n\nlinux-ppc64-buildlet:\n  go/bin/go test syscall

files to objdir when overlay is present\n\nThis cl is a roll-forward of golang.org/cl/265758, which was rolled back\nin golang.org/cl/268900. The changes made are removing cgofiles\nfrom the list of files that are copied to objdir (because the cgofiles\nthemselves aren't actually provided to the compiler) and fixing test\ncases to properly provide the overlay flag and to allow for paths with\nbackslashes (as in Windows).\n\nThe previous cl (golang.org/cl/262618) copied non-overlaid cgo files\nto objdir, mostly to get around the issue that otherwise cgo-generated\nfiles were written out with the wrong names (they'd get the base path\nof the overlay file containing the replaced contents, instead of the\nbase path of the path whose contents are being replaced). So that CL\nit would copy the files to objdir with the base path of the file\nbeing replaced to circumvent that.\n\nThis CL changes cmd/go and cmd/cgo so that instead of copying\nfiles, it passes the actual path of the file on disk either of\nthe original file (if it is not overlaid) or its replacement\nfile (if it is) as well as a flag --path_rewrite, newly added to\ncmd/cgo, that specifies the actual original file path that corresponds\nto the replaced files.\n\nUpdates #39958\n\nChange-Id: Ia45b022f9d27cfce0f9ec6da5f3a9f53654c67b8\nReviewed-on: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/269017\nTrust: Michael Matloob <matloob@golang.org>\nRun-TryBot: Michael Matloob <matloob@golang.org>\nTryBot-Result: Go Bot <gobot@golang.org>\nReviewed-by: Bryan C.
