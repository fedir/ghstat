everyone,\r\n\r\nI'd like to attach a spinner in a button when a div with a lot of graphs inside is loading. I found the use of `dcc.Loading` was good enough to attach the spinner to the loading div but not if I want the loading state of the div displayed anywhere else (in another element).\r\n\r\nSo, I'd like to catch the `loading_state` property of my div in a callback and render the children of the button depending on the `loading_state['is_loading']` value..\r\n\r\nI'm working with theses versions :\r\n```\r\ndash                               1.16.3\r\ndash-bootstrap-components          0.10.7\r\ndash-core-components               1.12.1\r\ndash-html-components

10\r\n    - Browser : chrome\r\n    - Version 86.0.4240.75\r\n\r\n**Bug description**\r\n\r\nI have the following code adapted from the [`dcc.Loading` documentation page](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/loading):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dash\r\nimport dash_html_components as html\r\nimport dash_core_components as dcc\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nfrom dash.dependencies import Input, Output\r\n\r\napp = dash.Dash(__name__)\r\n\r\napp.layout = html.Div(\r\n    children=[\r\n        html.H3(\"Edit text input to see loading state\"),\r\n        dcc.Input(id=\"loading-input-1\", value='Input triggers loading'),\r\n        html.Div(id=\"loading-output-1\"),\r\n        html.Div(id='loading-info')\r\n    ]\r\n)\r\n\r\n@app.callback(Output(\"loading-output-1\", \"children\"), [Input(\"loading-input-1\", \"value\")])\r\ndef input_triggers_spinner(value):\r\n    time.sleep(1)\r\n    return value\r\n\r\n@app.callback(Output('loading-info', 'children'), [Input(\"loading-output-1\", \"loading_state\")])\r\ndef update_loading_info(ld_state):\r\n    if ld_state is None:\r\n        return 'Loading State is None'\r\n    if ld_state['is_loading']:\r\n        return 'The div is loading'\r\n    return 'The div is not loading'\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    app.run_server(debug=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe property `loading_state` of the div is always `undefined` so the call back is called once with `None` as its value.\r\nThe `children` property of the div with `loading-info` as ìd` remains \"Loading state is None\".\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAs explained in the documentation of all components, the `loading_state` property has to be a dict including the `is_loading` key.\r\n\r\nWhen I type in the input, the `loading_state` of `loading-output-1` should change to `{is_loading': True, ... }`.\r\nThen, during ~1s, the `children` property of the `loading-info` div should be \"The div is loading\".\r\nFinally, the `loading_state` of `loading-output-1` should change back to to `{is_loading': False, ... }` and the `children` property of the `loading-info` div should become \"The div is not loading\".\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n![bug_loading_state](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15649177/96888137-96e92600-1485-11eb-9fb2-ca8ec55832ab.png)\r\n\r\nHere we see the behavior I tried to explain before.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or did I not understand the expected behavior of the `loading_state` property which seems to don't even exists.\r\n\r\nThank you
