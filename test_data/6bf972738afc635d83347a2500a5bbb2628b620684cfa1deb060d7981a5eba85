My first thought was to find a way to make a handler return some kind of `Result`, which would be tricky and probably require specialization for it to be ergonomic. After letting it rest for a few days I realized that I could still get quite close by making the `Response` take `Result`s and other types, and let those types set headers and response status. That's the idea behind this `SendResponse` trait.\n\nTo make some of this possible, the whole handler/router system was turned inside-out, resulting in the removal of `Find` and introduction of `HandleRequest`. An upside is that handler composition is more powerful, while a downside is that the compiler can't always infer the router type. The extra explicitness should hopefully not be too bad, though.\n\nA bonus effect is that the returned error from `Response::send` can be customized, making `Response::send_file` obsolete.\n\nCloses #109, closes #98 (`HandleRequest` can do that now).\n\nThis is a breaking change, since the input parameters and return values of `send` and `try_send` are changed, `send_file` is removed, and the difference between handlers and routers is more or less gone.","tree":{"sha":"a2e81c67a7e82aa430c51fb8e8ca70b76424827b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ogeon/rustful/git/trees/a2e81c67a7e82aa430c51fb8e8ca70b76424827b"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ogeon/rustful/git/commits/673cf55b40f48a729ebef99575a29f087818c0d8","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ogeon/rustful/commits/673cf55b40f48a729ebef99575a29f087818c0d8","html_url":"https://github.com/Ogeon/rustful/commit/673cf55b40f48a729ebef99575a29f087818c0d8","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ogeon/rustful/commits/673cf55b40f48a729ebef99575a29f087818c0d8/comments","author":{"login":"homu","id":10212162,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10212162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu","html_url":"https://github.com/homu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"homu","id":10212162,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10212162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu","html_url":"https://github.com/homu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"9c222bfb63c95b9c790bbc514b97800a312b1ffe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ogeon/rustful/commits/9c222bfb63c95b9c790bbc514b97800a312b1ffe","html_url":"https://github.com/Ogeon/rustful/commit/9c222bfb63c95b9c790bbc514b97800a312b1ffe"},{"sha":"cc01342934895fd45e0ca8fa836eb2337d74b72a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ogeon/rustful/commits/cc01342934895fd45e0ca8fa836eb2337d74b72a","html_url":"https://github.com/Ogeon/rustful/commit/cc01342934895fd45e0ca8fa836eb2337d74b72a"}]},{"sha":"cc01342934895fd45e0ca8fa836eb2337d74b72a","commit":{"author":{"name":"Erik Hedvall","email":"erikwhedvall@gmail.com","date":"2017-04-14T11:55:52Z"},"committer":{"name":"Erik Hedvall","email":"erikwhedvall@gmail.com","date":"2017-04-14T11:55:52Z"},"message":"Work a
