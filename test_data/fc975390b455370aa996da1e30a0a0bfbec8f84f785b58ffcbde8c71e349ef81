think that I get why phpstan reports the issue but I don't think it's correct.\r\n\r\nI want to document that the only accepted values of the function are an instance of `Bar` or a `string`. At the same time I obviously want to validate that the passed arguments are of the required types (I don't want to rely on a \"good user behavior\"), but according to phpstan I'm not able to do that.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something or is this a bug? Any suggestions on how to go around it? Or do you suggest that such validation is not neccessary and that I should rely on the phpstan to check the arguments somewhere where the function is called?\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @param Bar|string $a\r\n */\r\nfunction foo ($a) : bool {\r\n\tif ($a instanceof Bar) {\r\n\t\treturn true;\r\n\t} elseif (!is_string($a)) {\r\n\t\tthrow new \\Exception('Not Bar or string');\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\treturn false;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfoo(123); // I expect an exception here...\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
