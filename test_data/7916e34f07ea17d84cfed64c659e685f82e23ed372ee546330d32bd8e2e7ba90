The final rendered view has a table with couple of table rows but the first one is still static for testing purpose. The little jquery snippet above only triggers on the static row and not the dynamic rows from the `.each` block. \n\n```\n<tbody>\n  <tr class=\"clickable-row\" >\n    <td>Testrow</td>\n  </tr>\n  {{ _objects.each do |object| }}\n    <:blub:tablerow model=\"{{ object }}\" />\n  {{ end }}\n</tbody>\n```\n\nAnd the component tablerow.\n\n```\n<:Body>\n  <tr class=\"clickable-row\" >\n    <td>{{ object._data }}</td>\n  </tr>\n```\n\nThe jquery snippet should work on all table rows, shouldn't it? \nAny ideas or suggestions?\n\nEdit: While digging though other issue I stumbled over https://github.com/voltrb/volt/issues/184#issuecomment-98793210 \nSo it seems for now its the wanted behavior. After creating `def tablerow_ready` with the jquery snippet on the blub controller it worked like intended.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voltrb/volt/issues/271","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voltrb/volt","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voltrb/volt/issues/271/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voltrb/volt/issues/271/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voltrb/volt/issues/271/events","html_url":"https://github.com/voltrb/volt/issues/271","id":101295975,"number":271,"title":"{action}_ready javascript doesn't apply to component views","user":{"login":"dennym","id":1562328,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1562328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennym","html_url":"https://github.com/dennym","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennym/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennym/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennym/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennym/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennym/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennym/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennym/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennym/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennym/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-08-16T20:24:28Z","updated_at":"2015-08-16T20:34:07Z","closed_at":"2015-08-16T20:34:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have this in the few and it gets correctly served from the corresponding controller.

a suggestion: i use CodeClimate on most my projects (too)\n\nI noticed it's set up for volt, but not the code coverage part of it. It's easy to add with one gem and 2 lines of code. The hard work is done with the travis integration, it runs (like coverall i suppose) on a travis run.\n\nThe reason i suggest this is that you get line by line coverage analysis. Also a percentage by class.\nI usually sort by that percentage to see where i work on next. It's very motivating i find.\nAlso you have both the smells and coverage in the same tool.\n\nSo, give it a spin if you like.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voltrb/volt/issues/247","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voltrb/volt","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voltrb/volt/issues/247/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voltrb/volt/issues/247/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voltrb/volt/issues/247/events","html_url":"https://github.com/voltrb/volt/issues/247","id":94498596,"number":247,"title":"*** Error in `/usr/bin/ld': corrupted double-linked list: 0x09763d50 ***","user":{"login":"jpmermoz","id":743739,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/743739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmermoz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpmermoz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmermoz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmermoz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmerm
