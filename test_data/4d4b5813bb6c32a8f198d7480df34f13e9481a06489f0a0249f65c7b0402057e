It's all very ugly, and really needs to be streamlined.\r\n\r\nMigrating the Jinja templates over to React/Vue would significantly streamline the whole process, as templates would be only stored once, and no information would need to be duplicated. To support clients who don't have Javascript enabled, the templates can be rendered server-side before sending the rendered result plus Javascript over the pipe.\r\n\r\nThe primary drawback of this approach is twofold, as I see it:\r\n* The JS templates will need access to internal structures that ordinary API clients should not have access to (configuration, etc.) - in other words, there will need to be an internal backend API secured from access by the outside.\r\n* Introducing JS-backed SSR will add another moving part into the mix, namely, a Node server running alongside Flask. While Docker can hide this somewhat, administratiors opting to take the non-Docker route will have to install and maintain Node in addition to the other Python dependencies. That said, Node is already a buildtime requirement, so it might not be too bad.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Swizz/hyperapp-html/issues/18","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Swizz/hyperapp-html","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Swizz/hyperapp-html/issues/18/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Swizz/hyperapp-html/issues/18/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Swizz/hyperapp-html/issues/18/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Swizz/hyperapp-html/issues/18","id":400320280,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDAzMjAyODA=","number":18,"title":"Add support for head tags?

You don't see an error on the console, or anywhere.\r\n\r\nI think I've run into this a number of times while writing tests - many times I've had `jest` hanging for several minutes before finally reporting a timeout, with no real clue why this was happening... An actual exception getting throw would cause `jest` to halt - but instead, you have to wait for every test to time out, which can take a long time.\r\n\r\nI'm also now running into this in my [Component example](https://codesandbox.io/s/fre-component-i6sbs) - I had forgotten to declare `App.componentDidMount` and the effect in `useComponent` was attempting to call this... Instead of an error on the console, all the buttons simply stopped worked - there was no way to see why.\r\n\r\nI've been suspecting this had something to do with `flushWork`, so I made a quick change:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction flushWork(iniTime) {\r\n  try {\r\n    return workLoop(iniTime)\r\n  } catch(e) {\r\n    console.error(e)\r\n  } finally {\r\n    currentTask = null\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis revealed the error on the console! So far so good.\r\n\r\nBut this is just printing an error-message now, so this still wouldn't fix the problem under `jest`, since `console.error` just prints an error-message but doesn't work like an exception - so `jest` still won't know it happened.\r\n\r\nI also tried something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction flushWork(iniTime) {\r\n  try {\r\n    return workLoop(iniTime)\r\n  } catch(e) {\r\n    throw e // <-- re-throwing the error\r\n  } finally {\r\n    currentTask = null\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that also just silences the error. 🤨\r\n\r\nIt's weird, because `try/finally` without a `catch` isn't suppose to handle errors at all - so if you do [this](https://jsfiddle.net/mindplay/pts5Lurd/1/):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction flurp() {\r\n  throw \"UGH\";\r\n}\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n  flurp()\r\n} finally {\r\n  console.log(\"NP!\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will see the error-message for the exception, as expected.\r\n\r\nI can't figure out why it behaves differently in `fre`... 🤷‍♂️\r\n\r\n(I also suspect this could be related to the problem with the browser stalling, as mentioned on Twitter - if it keeps running through the work-loop trying to complete the same task, but an error prevents it from ever finishing the next task in the queue? Just a guess.)\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/issues/917","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jorgebucaran/hyperapp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/issues/917/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/issues/917/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/issues/917/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/issues/917","id":558070143,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NTgwNzAxNDM=","number":917,"title":"Website: Minor niggles.","user":{"login":"zaceno","id":2061445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjE0NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2061445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaceno","html_url":"https://github.com/zaceno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaceno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaceno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaceno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaceno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaceno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaceno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaceno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaceno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaceno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":817108559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MTcxMDg1NTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/labels/Fix","name":"Fix","color":"ffee00","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2020-01-31T11:15:38Z","updated_at":"2020-07-17T17:01:07Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T17:01:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"- ~The counter live example on the front page has a typo.

RenderOnce }),\r\n    `state is rendered ${state} times`,\r\n    h('button', { onclick: s => ++s }, 'Increment')\r\n  ]),\r\n  node: document.body\r\n})\r\n```\r\n[Codepen to reproduce](https://codepen.io/sergey-shpak/pen/yLyboKX)\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n`RenderOnce` is called each state change\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n`RenderOnce` is called only once","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/issues/916","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jorgebucaran/hyperapp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/issues/916/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/issues/916/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/issues/916/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/issues/916","id":557256438,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NTcyNTY0Mzg=","number":916,"title":"Website

Summary\r\n\r\nI've made up my mind about this issue. I'm going with the dev-only middleware option. That would be the 🎉 in @okwolf's two-choice poll. This should tie in with https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/issues/417. I'll close there and summarize everything here.\r\n\r\nThank you everyone, for your feedback! ❤️ \r\n\r\n> Technically, this isn't middleware, I've been calling it so incorrectly. Hyperapp will have no middleware feature as we know it from other projects such as Redux or Express. In the past we've used _plugins_ (pre-V1) to integrate to ReduxDevTools and later V1 wiredActions for the same purpose. V2 will provide its own DevTools instead. \r\n\r\nWe want a top-class development experience when working with Hyperapp. Tools like [okwolf/logger](https://github.com/okwolf/logger), [mrozbarry/debug](https://github.com/mrozbarry/hyperapp-debug) and [hyperstart/devtools](https://github.com/hyperstart/hyperapp-devtools) have helped us along the way and will be the inspiration for what's coming next. \r\n\r\nStarting with V2 we'll be able to compile our apps for production _or_ development. Development mode will have useful warnings, logging, session import/export and time-traveling built right into your app!\r\n\r\nThis will work by [setting an environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Env), e.g., <samp>NODE_ENV=production</samp> or <samp>NODE_ENV=development</samp>. What will be default? \r\n\r\nFor CDN users, <samp>hyperapp.js</samp> will be the development build and a new <samp>hyperapp.min.js </samp> will be available.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
