of a question for @DanSimon \r\n\r\nIf sending a get request to redis you should generally use `mapTry`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nredisClient.get(ByteString(name)).mapTry {\r\n  case Success(value) =>\r\n    // data found\r\n  case Failure(_) =>\r\n    // no data found\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, memcache returns an option so `map` is sufficient unless you want to handle the case where a incorrect response is sent by memcached.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmemcacheClient.get(ByteString(name)).map {\r\n  case Some(Value(_, data, _)) =>\r\n    // data found\r\n  case None =>\r\n    // no data
