As the application grows, it gets harder for you to know where the request has passed through and it doesn't compose as well. For example, in a single router (controller), you have routes that require authentication and some that does not, and declaring those in a routing-style controller is often too verbose and repetitive.\n\nIf you have examples, snippets from real applications, it would be even better (I can provide some too)!
