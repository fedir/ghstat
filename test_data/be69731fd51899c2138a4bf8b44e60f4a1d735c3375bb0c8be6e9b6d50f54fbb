the ConditionalHeaders Feature is installed, the Last-Modified-Headers sent by the server are always \"\\<Local-Date-and-Time\\> GMT\" which is obviously wrong for servers with a default timezone with a non-zero offset.\r\n\r\nFor example when serving a file with a timestamp of \"Sun, 04 Mar 2018 15:12:23 GMT\" (= \"Sun, 04 Mar 2018 16:12:23 GMT+01:00\") from a server with default Timezone of GMT+01:00, the server will send a Last-Modified-Header of \"Sun, 04 Mar 2018 16:12:23 GMT\".\r\n\r\n\r\nA simple setup in which this can be reproduced is:\r\n\r\nCreate a local file:\r\n`> touch /some/where/foo`\r\n\r\nSet system default timezone to GMT+1 and start a server:\r\n```\r\nTimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"GMT+01:00\"))\r\n\r\nembeddedServer(Netty, \"127.0.0.1\", 8080)

http://localhost:7070/foo , compare Last-Modified in response to actual file modification time\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand the code, the problem seems to be in io.ktor.content.LastModifiedVersion which takes values in local system time and then simply appends UTC as timezone to the local value when creating the Last-Modified-Header:\r\n```\r\ndata class LastModifiedVersion(val lastModified: LocalDateTime) : Version {\r\n    \r\n    [...]\r\n\r\n    override fun appendHeadersTo(builder: HeadersBuilder) {\r\n        builder.lastModified(lastModified.atZone(ZoneOffset.UTC))\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomewhat more involved TestCase that demonstrates the problem:
