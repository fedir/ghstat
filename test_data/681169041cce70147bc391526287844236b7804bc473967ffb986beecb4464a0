and graphics:\n\n - Super long line drawing + fixing matrix multiplication\n\n   New strategy: determine where the line leaves the canvas, and only draw\n   the bit that's visible.\n\n - Do hv() on chartarea in renderOther too\n\n - Serialize some doubles with higher precision: fixes \"jumpiness\" at high zoom\n\n - Move createPens... before layouting code\n\n   This is its proper position, as the pens are already being used in the\n   axes drawing code. We would get performance issues before when on-demand\n   loading is enabled and the user zooms all the way in and then all the\n   way out: this would generate way too many ticks.\n\n - Eliminated a few const casts\n\n - Optimization: jump ahead to right before zoomStart when using DateTimeScale\n\n - If zoom level gets very large, int may overflow\n\n   So use long long instead\n\n - Added extra zoom level for maxZoom\n\n   This makes the spacing of the ticks at maxZoom the same as the spacing\n   of the ticks when completely zoomed out.\n\n   e.g. when maxZoom is 10:\n   zoom level | zoom factor\n   ------------|-------------\n             1 |         1.0\n             2 |         2.0\n             3 |         4.0\n             4 |         8.0\n             5 |        10.0\n\n   (zoom level 5 is the new zoom level here, capped at maxZoom (instead of\n   16.0), only active when at maxZoom)\n\n - On-demand loading for Y axes (labels and ticks
