now the formbuilder will collect all `fieldset.tab legend` to build tabs in one place.\r\nYou can't have multiple sections of fieldset.tab across the form.\r\n\r\nThe problem was described here: https://forum.getfuelcms.com/discussion/2345/form-tabs-fieldsets/p1 with no solution.\r\n\r\nThe way fieldset.tab works is, every form field that comes after `'a' => ['type' => 'fieldset', 'class' => 'tab', 'label' => 'a'],` is going to end up in a tab, even if you setup a non tab fieldset section `'k' => ['type' => 'fieldset', 'label' => 'Break out tabs'],` and then more fieldsets with tabs (x and y).\r\n\r\nAll tabs will end up at the top of the form or better the first defined fieldset.tab.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1337223/92912975-9db65f00-f42a-11ea-965e-170947700efc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n'a' => ['type' => 'fieldset', 'class' => 'tab', 'label' => 'a'],\r\n// ... some fields\r\n'b' => ['type' => 'fieldset', 'class' => 'tab', 'label' => 'b'],\r\n// some fields\r\n\r\n'k' => ['type' => 'fieldset', 'label' => 'Break out tabs'],\r\n// some more fields unrelated to fieldset b \r\n\r\n'x' => ['type' => 'fieldset', 'class' => 'tab', 'label' => 'x'],\r\n// ... some fields\r\n'y' => ['type' => 'fieldset', 'class' => 'tab', 'label' => 'y'],\r\n// some fields\r\n\r\n'z' => ['type' => 'fieldset', 'label' => 'Break out tabs'],\r\n// some more fields unrelated to fieldset y \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIn order to group fieldset.tab a and b in the beginning of the form and fieldset. x and y at the end I would propose the following change:\r\n\r\n\r\n~~1. Update jQuery to the latest version of the 1.x branch at least to 1.8 because I use [`addBack()`](https://api.jquery.com/addBack/)~~ Added a check for `addBack()` https://github.com/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/pull/571#issue-485365603\r\n\r\n2. replace in BaseFuelController.js the following function\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\t_initFormTabs : function(context){\r\n\t\tif (!$('.form_tabs', context).length){\r\n\r\n\t\t\tvar tabId = 'tabs_' + jqx.config.uriPath.replace(/[\\/|:]/g, '_').substr(5); // remove fuel_\r\n\t\t\tvar tabCookieSettings = {group: this.uiCookie, name: tabId, params: {path: jqx.config.cookieDefaultPath}}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tvar tabs = '<div id=\"fuel_form_tabs\" class=\"form_tabs\"><ul>';\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// Group\r\n\t\t\t$fieldsets = $('fieldset.tab', context).not('fieldset.tab fieldset', context);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif(!$.fn.addBack){\r\n\t\t\t\t$.fn.addBack = $.fn.andSelf;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t$fieldsets.each(function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tif ( ! $(this).closest('.fieldset-grouped').length){\r\n\t\t\t\t\t$(this).nextUntil('fieldset:not([class])').addBack().wrapAll(\"<div class='fieldset-grouped' />\");\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t// loop through groups and create tabs from <legend>\r\n\t\t\t$('.fieldset-grouped').each(function(idx, context){\r\n\t\t\t\t// in order to change as little as possible from the original code, I keep context as variable, but it's the current context of .fielset-grouped!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\ttabs = '<div id=\"fuel_form_tabs_' + idx + '\" class=\"form_tabs\"><ul>'\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// prevent nested fieldsets from showing up with not()\r\n\t\t\t\t$legends = $('fieldset.tab legend', context).not('fieldset.tab fieldset legend', context);\r\n\t\t\t\t$legends.each(function(i){\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif ($(this).parent().attr('id') != '') {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$(this).parent().attr('id', 'fieldset' + i + '_' + idx).attr('data-index', i + '_' + idx);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvar id = ($(this).parent().attr('id'));\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvar text = $(this).text();\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttabs += '<li id=\"fueltab' + i + '_' + idx + '\"><a href=\"#' + id + '\">' + text + '</a></li>';\r\n\t\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t\t\t$legends.hide();\r\n\t\t\t\ttabs += '</ul><div class=\"clear\"></div></div>';\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tvar startIndex = parseInt($.supercookie(tabCookieSettings.group, tabCookieSettings.name));\r\n\t\t\t\tif (!startIndex) startIndex = 0;\r\n\t\t\t\ttabs += '<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"__fuel_selected_tab__\" id=\"__fuel_selected_tab__\" value=\"' + startIndex + '\" />';\r\n\t\t\t\t$legends.filter(':first').parent().before(tabs);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t$('#form').trigger('fuel_form_tabs_loaded', [$('#fuel_form_tabs_' + idx)] );\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t$tabs = $('.form_tabs ul', context);\r\n\t\t\t\t$tabs.simpleTab({cookie: tabCookieSettings});\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tvar tabCallback = function(e, index, selected, content, settings){\r\n\t\t\t\t\t$('#__fuel_selected_tab__').val(index);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t$tabs.bind('tabClicked', tabCallback);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// check if there are any errors and highlight them\r\n\t\t\t\t$legends.parent().find('.error_highlight').each(function(i){\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvar fieldsetIndex = $(this).closest('fieldset').data('index');\r\n\t\t\t\t\t$('#fueltab' + fieldsetIndex).addClass('taberror');\r\n\t\t\t\t})\r\n\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1337223/92912667-4a441100-f42a-11ea-983f-ff77df5c7ea8.png)\r\n\r\nI did not create a pull request, because at this point I would like to have the devs to look over this and decide if this is a good way to implement and if a jquery update is possible and mybe they will notice some side effects.\r\n\r\nAnd if it ends up in Fuel (which would be nice), it needs to be documented and made clear, that once you use fieldset.tab you need to use blank fieldset to break out of tabs. Which might not be very intuitive.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if this ended up working in Fuel

installation folder to the proper RewriteBase directory. The default is your web server's root directory (e.g \"/\"), but if you have FUEL CMS installed in a sub folder, you will need to add the path to line 5. If you are using the folder it was zipped up in from GitHub, it would be RewriteBase /FUEL-CMS-master/.\r\n\r\n    In some server environments, you may need to add a \"?\" after index.php in the .htaccess like so: RewriteRule .* index.php?/$0 [L]\r\n\r\n    NOTE: This is the only step needed if you want to use FUEL without the CMS.\r\n    2\r\n    Install the database\r\n\r\n    Install the FUEL CMS database by first creating the database in MySQL and then importing the fuel/install/fuel_schema.sql file. After creating the database, change the database configuration found in fuel/application/config/database.php to include your hostname (e.g. localhost), username, password and the database to match the new database you created.\r\n    3\r\n    Make folders writable\r\n\r\n    Make the following folders writable (666 = rw-rw-rw, 777 = rwxrwxrwx, etc.):\r\n        /var/www/html/FUEL-CMS-master/fuel/application/cache/\r\n        (folder for holding cache files)\r\n        /var/www/html/FUEL-CMS-master/fuel/application/cache/dwoo/\r\n        (folder for holding template cache files)\r\n        /var/www/html/FUEL-CMS-master/fuel/application/cache/dwoo/compiled\r\n        (for writing compiled template files)\r\n        /var/www/html/FUEL-CMS-master/assets/images\r\n        (for managing image assets in the CMS)\r\n    4\r\n    Make configuration changes\r\n        In the fuel/application/config/config.php, change the $config['encryption_key'] to your own unique key.\r\n        In the fuel/application/config/MY_fuel.php file, change the $config['admin_enabled'] configuration property to TRUE. If you do not want the CMS accessible, leave it as FALSE.\r\n        In the fuel/application/config/MY_fuel.php file, change the $config['fuel_mode'] configuration property to AUTO.
