Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\r\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\r\nWhen Mithril renders a component with two `span` elements (it can be any element with `display: inline/inline-block`) the generated code should be equal to writing the two inline elements on multiple lines.  \r\n\r\nThis example should clear things up a bit:\r\n```js\r\nm(\"div\", [\r\n    m(\"span\", \"left\"),\r\n    m(\"span\", \"right\")\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould generate\r\n```html\r\n<div>\r\n<span>left</span>\r\n<span>right</span>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nwhich should render as\r\n```\r\nleft right\r\n```\r\nbut it doesn't.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\r\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\r\nThe generated output is\r\n```html\r\n<div><span>left></span><span>right</span></div>\r\n```\r\nwhich renders as\r\n```\r\nleftright\r\n```\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\r\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\r\nA workaround is adding an empty span element or a space character at the end of the first string.\r\n```js\r\nm(\"div\", [\r\n    m(\"span\", \"left\"),\r\n    m(\"span\", \"\"),\r\n    m(\"span\", \"right\")\r\n]);\r\n\r\n// or\r\n\r\nm(\"div\", [\r\n    m(\"span\", \"left \"),\r\n    m(\"span\", \"right\")\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a JSX-styled code, you can add a `&nbsp;` between the two tags.\r\n```jsx\r\n<span>left</span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<span>right</span>\r\n```

Precedent React convention tends towards components that expose a custom attribute / props interface and accept the view / render function in the place of `children`, which makes a certain amount of sense and certainly involves less typing ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to implement this pattern in Mithril I end up unexpectedly having to query `vnode.children[0].children` from the consuming component to access the function I passed in as the last argument — I would expect this to be exposed as `vnode.children[0]`. \r\n\r\nWhy might this be?

learning mithril and I was wondering if I'm doing this the wrong way. I was reading the request API and put up together a simple component like the doc\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar Data = {\r\n    ads: {\r\n        list: [],\r\n        fetch: function() {\r\n            m.request({\r\n                method: \"GET\",\r\n                url: \"/api/v1/ads\",\r\n            })\r\n            .then(function(items) {\r\n                Data.ads.list = items\r\n            })\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I have my table like this\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar table = {\r\n    oninit: Data.ads.fetch,\r\n\r\n    view: function (vnode) {\r\n        return m(\"table.table.table-striped.table-hover\", [\r\n            m(\"thead\", [m(\"tr\", [\r\n                m(\"th\", \"Id\"),\r\n                m(\"th\", \"Remetente\"),\r\n                m(\"th\", \"Tipo\"),\r\n                m(\"th\", \"Valor\")\r\n            ])]),\r\n            m(\"tbody.list\", [\r\n                Data.ads.list.map(function (ad) {\r\n                    return m(\"tr\", [\r\n                        m(\"td.id\", ad.id),\r\n                        m(\"td.remetente\", ad.remetente),\r\n                        m(\"td.tipo\", ad.tipo),\r\n                        m(\"td.valor\", ad.valor)\r\n                    ])\r\n                })\r\n\r\n            ])\r\n        ])\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I was trying to do is use a third party lib to make my table searchable and sortable.

I want to advocate for the opposite position.\r\n\r\nI maintain several apps and SDKs that must provide unit tests, integration tests and functional tests. My deliverables are built either for Node.js or the browser, and tests may be bundled into the app itself. All of the tests for each should run with the same one command, returning a exit code equal to the number of failures.\r\n\r\nGiven this, I want programmatic access to `ospec` results that I may easily consume and deliver in a custom CI or test procedure. I don't want to parse what another reporter outputs to get this information, which is the consequence of black-boxing reporters.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nThe `report()` function in `ospec.js` [assumes STDOUT and STDERR are sufficient for reporting](https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/blob/next/ospec/ospec.js#L237), blocking all access to the results array. This forces consumers to run `ospec` as a child process and pipe its results to a stream that may parse results from a string.\r\n\r\nBut that's assuming you run tests in Node. If you run ospec tests in the browser, an entirely different approach is necessary to extract results.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nPass a custom, and optional reporter callback to `o.run()`. If the callback is not present, fall back to default behavior. The function accepts the test results array as its only parameter.\r\n\r\nIf you want details on how this would go, consider the following two cases where I run a bundled browser app and a bundled Node app. Note how the custom reporter exists to talk back to the test runner, which then translates that into an exit code.\r\n\r\n# Browser app case\r\n\r\n## Runner script\r\n\r\n    const {Chrome} = require('navalia'); // headless Chrome\r\n    const WebSocket = require('ws');\r\n\r\n\r\n    const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 6262 });\r\n    const chrome = new Chrome();\r\n\r\n    wss.on('connection', (ws) => {\r\n        ws.on('message', (results) => {\r\n            // Clean up\r\n            chrome.done();\r\n\r\n            const {appName, failures} = JSON.parse(results);\r\n            const nfails = failures.length;\r\n\r\n            if (nfails > 0) {\r\n                console.error(`${appName}: ${nfails} failures`);\r\n\r\n                for (const {message, stack} of failures) {\r\n                    console.error(message);\r\n                    console.error(stack);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // Non-zero exit code will fail CI build.\r\n            process.exit(nfails);\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    await chrome.goto(`file://${__dirname}/dist/index.html`);\r\n\r\n\r\n## In the test build's `index.html`\r\n\r\n    o.run((results) => {\r\n        const report = {\r\n            appName: document.title,\r\n            failures: results\r\n                .filter(({pass}) => {\r\n                    return !pass;\r\n                })\r\n                .map((result) => {\r\n                    return {\r\n                        context: result.context,\r\n                        message: result.message,\r\n                        stack: result.error.stack,\r\n                    };\r\n                });\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        const client = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:6262');\r\n\r\n        client.send(JSON.stringify(report));\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n# Node.js case\r\n\r\n## Runner script\r\n\r\n    const child_process = require('child_process');\r\n\r\n    const handle = child_process.spawn('node', [`${__dirname}/dist/index.js`], {\r\n        stdio: 'inherit', // So the results printed in index.js appear in this process' STDIO streams\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    handle.on('close', (code) => process.exit(code));\r\n\r\n\r\n## In the test build's `index.js`\r\n\r\n    o.run((results) => {\r\n        const failures = results.filter(({pass}) => !pass);\r\n\r\n        for (const {message, stack} of failures) {\r\n            console.error(`${message}\\n${stack}\\n\\n`);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        process.exit(results.filter(({pass}) => !pass).length);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n## Anticipated discussion points\r\n\r\n* **Should the results array be deeply copied before sent to the reporter function to protect data integrity?** I'm thinking no. If ospec gives me data that's not meant for modification and I modify it, that's on me.  \r\n* **Should the results be passed as is, or in a different representation?**. Be aware that passing the results array as-is means that future changes to a test result object is a breaking change for reporters. If someone is concerned by someone knowing more internals, I'd argue I have to know internals to parse ospec's stdio streams anyway.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/2016","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/mithril.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/2016/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/2016/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/2016/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/2016","id":274443855,"number":2016,"title":"state always equal in onbeforeupdate hook","user":{"login":"bloody-ux","id":19991767,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19991767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloody-ux","html_url":"https://github.com/bloody-ux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloody-ux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloody-ux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloody-ux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloody-ux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloody-ux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloody-ux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloody-ux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloody-ux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloody-ux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2017-11-16T09:16:31Z","updated_at":"2017-11-20T08:33:24Z","closed_at":"2017-11-20T08:33:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In below code, when state is changed, `vnode.state` is always equal to `oldVnode.state`.
