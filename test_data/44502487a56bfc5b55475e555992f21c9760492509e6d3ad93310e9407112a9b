As far as I know, the way our code works is to replace the content of a div with the content of the add-in.  I have an add-in built in mithril which appears on the website as a menu item in the left hand navigation.  The other add-ins are in the left hand nav and NOT built in mithril/do not have anything to do with my application.  Therefore it is impossible for me to add routes for all of these other add-ins in my m.route call.  What happens is, the main website redirects to the add-in I selected, but then mithril's routing kicks in after the fact and redirects back to my default route.\r\n\r\nI've tried everything I can think of, and am currently doing the following (see below).  Based on this quote \"Note that to redirect to a different page outside of the scope of Mithril's routing, you should use window.location\", from this link, I would think that this would work:\r\n\r\nhttps://mithril.js.org/archive/v0.2.5/mithril.route.html\r\n\r\n(I am using a newer version of mithril (1.1.6), but I assume this documentation still applies):\r\n\r\nI should add a little more background - our main website provides hooks for \"initialize\", \"focus\", and \"blur\".  Initialize runs when people select your add-in for the very first time in the session, focus runs at various points whne doing stuff within the add-in, and blur runs when you leave the add-in by clicking on another one or leaving the site altogether.  So I am trying the following:\r\n\r\n\t\t\tblur: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tconst hash = window.location.hash;\r\n\t\t\t\tm.route.set(`/external/${hash.substring(1, hash.length)}`);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tm.route(document.getElementById(\"container\"), \"/dashboard/manage\", {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"/home/:dashboardId\": homePage,\r\n\t\t\t\t\"/dashboard/manage\": dashboardManagerPage,\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t//TODO: Change dashboardId and snapshotId to just id\r\n\t\t\t\t\"/dashboard/:dashboardId\": dashboardPage,\r\n\t\t\t\t\"/dashboard/:dashboardId/:action\": dashboardPage,\r\n\t\t\t\t\"/dashboard/:dashboardId/:action/:dateRange/:filters\": dashboardPage,\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\"/snapshot/:snapshotId\": dashboardPage,\r\n\t\t\t\t\"/snapshot/:snapshotId/:action\": dashboardPage,\r\n\t\t\t\t\"/snapshot/:snapshotId/:action/:dateRange/:filters\": dashboardPage,\r\n\t\t\t\t\"/external/:hash\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tonmatch(args) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twindow.location.href = window.location.origin + window.location.pathname + \"#\" + args.hash;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\nThe onmatch runs correctly and calls the location.href and changes the url, however, since I am still in the main application's framework, mithril is still active and therefore still checks the route and defaults back to /dashboard/manage.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to \"kill\" mithril on blur or tell it to stop routing?\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nNavigate to the add-in the user selects\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nNavigates to the add-in the user selects, but then the mithril router kicks in and changes the url to dashboard/manage\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nNo idea, I've tried everything\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\nThis is a secure application so I can't really provide links.  Information about the sdk I am building an add-in for is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://my.geotab.com/sdk/#/addins\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nI want the url to be the url of the new add-in selected/tell mithril not to route/kill/\"unmount\" mithril\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\nMithril 1.1.6\r\nAll browsers\r\nAll OS\r\n\r\nI apologize if this is not the right spot for this, but appreciate any help/ideas that can be provided.

In all cases `nextSibling.parentNode`  becomes null:\r\n1. In `updateNodes` when the keys between the compared nodes match while traversing the nodes backwards.\r\n   * `nextSibling` is assigned to `o.dom` of the element that got updated. `o.dom` can be removed from the dom if the tags are different, causing `o.dom.parentNode` to be null. `nextSibling` is set to `o.dom` causing the error if `insertNode` is eventually called with the same `nextSibling`. \r\nhttps://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/blob/ec43ca089c67b1af3bc3f729d18dd5eaa283ea53/render/render.js#L314-L318\r\nhttps://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/blob/ec43ca089c67b1af3bc3f729d18dd5eaa283ea53/render/render.js#L322-L328\r\n    * Additionally, this can happen when there are more old nodes than new nodes. In this case the call to `updateNode` the next sibling is determined by calling `getNextSibling` with the old nodes. If an old node exists but was removed it could return that node which would be set to `nextSibling`.\r\nhttps://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/blob/ec43ca089c67b1af3bc3f729d18dd5eaa283ea53/render/render.js#L462-L467\r\n2. In `updateNodes` when keys do not match between compared nodes while traversing backwards: \r\n   * `nextSibling` is set to the node that gets created. \r\nhttps://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/blob/ec43ca089c67b1af3bc3f729d18dd5eaa283ea53/render/render.js#L328-L330\r\nBut that node can be a fragment and `parentNode` for a fragment is also null.\r\nhttps://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/blob/ec43ca089c67b1af3bc3f729d18dd5eaa283ea53/render/render.js#L92-L102\r\n\r\nThose are the only cases where `nextSibling` is set to a value without a parent as far as I could tell.\r\n\r\nThis commit: https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/commit/02aab654f0b1b02e35234fca9dc47c306ba62bd7 removed the check for `nextSibling.parentNode` inside `insertNode`. This is causing the underlying issues to not be hidden. Whereas before the commit the error wasn't present, there still was issues with ordering of the rendered elements since the check caused `appendChild` to be called instead of `insertBefore`.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nIn the first case above the old element `o.dom` was removed. Then it's assigned to `nextSibling`. Instead I think `v.dom` should be the next sibling since it is the element that is on the dom.\r\n```javascript\r\nupdateNode(parent, o, v, hooks, getNextSibling(old, oldEnd + 1, nextSibling), ns)\r\nnextSibling = v.dom\r\n```\r\n`getNextSibling` should be updated to not return a dom element if it doesn't have a parent. That way it doesn't set `nextSibling` to a removed node.\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction getNextSibling(vnodes, i, \r\n    for (; i < vnodes.length; \r\n        if (vnodes[i] != null && vnodes[i].dom != null && vnodes[i].dom.parentNode != null) return vnodes[i].dom\r\n    }\r\n    return nextSibling\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd for the second case the created fragment is set to `nextSibling`. Instead `v.dom` should be used since the fragment itself isn't a part of the dom. `v.dom` is already set to the first child of the fragment.\r\n```javascript\r\ncreateNode(parent, v, hooks, ns, nextSibling)\r\nnextSibling = v.dom\r\n```\r\nI did some testing with the above changes and it appears to fix the error successfully and keep the correct order of elements. But I'm not too familiar with the code so I'm looking for some feedback.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to create the PR with these fixes if they're correct.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\nSimple steps to reproduce the first case:\r\n1. Render node:\r\n   * Tag \"div\" with key \"2\".\r\n2. Render nodes:\r\n   * Tag \"span\" with key \"1\".\r\n   * Tag \"span\" with key \"2\".\r\n\r\nCode snippet:

Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\r\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\r\nWhen Mithril renders a component with two `span` elements (it can be any element with `display: inline/inline-block`) the generated code should be equal to writing the two inline elements on multiple lines.  \r\n\r\nThis example should clear things up a bit:\r\n```js\r\nm(\"div\", [\r\n    m(\"span\", \"left\"),\r\n    m(\"span\", \"right\")\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould generate\r\n```html\r\n<div>\r\n<span>left</span>\r\n<span>right</span>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nwhich should render as\r\n```\r\nleft right\r\n```\r\nbut it doesn't.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\r\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\r\nThe generated output is\r\n```html\r\n<div><span>left></span><span>right</span></div>\r\n```\r\nwhich renders as\r\n```\r\nleftright\r\n```\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\r\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\r\nA workaround is adding an empty span element or a space character at the end of the first string.\r\n```js\r\nm(\"div\", [\r\n    m(\"span\", \"left\"),\r\n    m(\"span\", \"\"),\r\n    m(\"span\", \"right\")\r\n]);\r\n\r\n// or\r\n\r\nm(\"div\", [\r\n    m(\"span\", \"left \"),\r\n    m(\"span\", \"right\")\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a JSX-styled code, you can add a `&nbsp;` between the two tags.\r\n```jsx\r\n<span>left</span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<span>right</span>\r\n```

Precedent React convention tends towards components that expose a custom attribute / props interface and accept the view / render function in the place of `children`, which makes a certain amount of sense and certainly involves less typing ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to implement this pattern in Mithril I end up unexpectedly having to query `vnode.children[0].children` from the consuming component to access the function I passed in as the last argument — I would expect this to be exposed as `vnode.children[0]`. \r\n\r\nWhy might this be?

learning mithril and I was wondering if I'm doing this the wrong way.

But for it to work, I need the whole component rendered, then apply it.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do this or I should go with another approach to this problem ?","score":1.0}]}
