This value represents 20.013 years. That means that any browser that successfully visits that site will never allow it to be visited over a non-secure HTTP connection for at least 20 years. The only way to reset is for the server to set it to '0' explicitly and then the browser user has to visit the site again. I would suggest a more reasonable value of 1 month, or 2628000 seconds.\n\n```\nincludeSubdomains\n```\n\nThis is an optional value and it has potentially far-reaching effects and should not be included in a default setup.  By setting this, you are telling every browser that visits this site over an HTTPS connection successfully (even once) that **ALL SUBDOMAINS** of this domain shall also be **REQUIRED** to visit over an https connection.  So for example, if there is a pre-existing `www.example.com` website which does not have a TLS certificate, and then the developer of this Cuba mini-app decides to setup this secure little mini-site on HTTPS. From now on every browser that visited the mini-site will refuse to load the www site over simple HTTP since it is not protected by TLS!! This (spec optional) setting should be removed from Cuba's defaults.\n\n```\npreload\n```\n\npreload is another optional part of the spec, and is dangerous to include in a default setup.  By having this set you are requesting (or allowing to be requested) that this domain be **permanently** hard-coded into the Chrome browser (and others who use their service) that they should only be allowed to see the site over HTTPS. This setting, when present, might allow an attacker to add the site on the HSTS preload site (https://hstspreload.appspot.com) and force **all** Chrome users to only allow access to this domain, and all sub-domains, over HTTPS. This option should also be removed from the defaults.\n\nAll of this is well documented here:\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security\n\nTwitter Secure Headers project, also does not use the optional attributes:\n\nhttps://github.com/twitter/secureheaders\n\nYou should also include instructions for how to override specific security settings as appropriate for a Cuba app in the docs. I am doing so in my Cuba app with something like this which seems to be working as expected:\n\n```\nrequire 'cuba'\nrequire 'cuba/safe'\n...\nCuba.plugin Cuba::Safe::SecureHeaders\nCuba.settings[:default_headers].merge!({\"Strict-Transport-Security\" => \"max-age=2628000\"})\n...\nCuba.define do\n  ...\nend\n```\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soveran/cuba/issues/70","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soveran/cuba","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soveran/cuba/issues/70/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soveran/cuba/issues/70/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soveran/cuba/issues/70/events","html_url":"https://github.com/soveran/cuba/issues/70","id":111611059,"number":70,"title":"where can I change the server port","user":{"login":"lostpupil","id":2015695,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2015695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostpupil","html_url":"https://github.com/lostpupil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostpupil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostpupil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostpupil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostpupil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostpupil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostpupil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostpupil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostpupil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostpupil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-10-15T12:59:36Z","updated_at":"2015-10-16T04:57:03Z","closed_at":"2015-10-16T04:57:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry for this question, but I went through the doc and code twice. \nDidn't see anything mention how to change the port.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soveran/cuba/issues/69","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soveran/cuba","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soveran/cuba/issues/69/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soveran/cuba/issues/69/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soveran/cuba/issues/69/events","html_url":"https://github.com/soveran/cuba/issues/69","id":105824196,"number":69,"title":"404 default Content-Type not set","user":{"login":"dkullmann","id":422899,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/422899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkullmann","html_url":"https://github.com/dkullmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkullmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkullmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkullmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkullmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkullmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkullmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkullmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkullmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkullmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-09-10T14:41:09Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T08:00:41Z","closed_at":"2016-05-17T08:00:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The `Content-Type` isn't being set when a `404` occurs on our application, which means that plain text is rendered: http://cl.ly/image/1f401k340S29\n\nIs this the intended default behavior?\n\nI believe that the way it works is all 200's have a default `Content-Type` of `text/html` if not otherwise set, but other status codes have no `Content-Type` at all ([see here](https://github.com/soveran/cuba/blob/8e0e77d8a
