Its works, in general. But it has a number of specific 'hacks' to make it work and I need to work with the turbo author to determine the best ways to refit a solution that is more cross platform and better implemented.\n\nThings to be very wary of:\n- The Poll system has been gutted - it works, but its missing all the error systems (I had all sorts of issues with it). \n- The implementation currently uses a mish-mash of Network-tcp-server ffi and Lua syscall. I intend to move it all to the lightweight Lua systcall ( this is how the original turbo mostly works - using linux based system calls).\n- WebDruino is built for mainly locally serving an Arduino and ITS NOT COMPLETE. Dont expect too much of it to work.\n  So. Its all a work in progress - but I wanted to get access for kernelsauce, there may be some things that can be used. Im not certain at the moment, but once Network-tcp-server is removed it should almost be a pure turbo system with minor changes in the polling and socket areas.\n\nhttps://github.com/dlannan/webdruino.git\nAny questions feel free to email me at dlannan at gagagames dot com\nCheers,\nDave\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/issues/184","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/issues/184/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/issues/184/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/issues/184/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kernelsauce/turbo/issues/184","id":69760820,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2OTc2MDgyMA==","number":184,"title":"TCP client example.","user":{"login":"shadylabs","id":7526407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjY0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7526407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadylabs","html_url":"https://github.com/shadylabs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadylabs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadylabs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadylabs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadylabs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadylabs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadylabs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadylabs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadylabs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadylabs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-04-21T06:59:50Z","updated_at":"2015-04-21T07:42:59Z","closed_at":"2015-04-21T07:42:59Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hi,\nI can't figure this magic number \"fd\" in  **IOStream(fd, io_loop, max_buffer_size)**.
