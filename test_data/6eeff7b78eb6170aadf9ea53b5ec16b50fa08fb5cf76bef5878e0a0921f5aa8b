Is Dash not capable of updating hover text? \r\n\r\nThanks","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/221","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/221/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/221/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/221/events","html_url":"https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/221","id":304137191,"number":221,"title":"Error when trying to use Dash in a flask server","user":{"login":"jejesh26","id":37058666,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/37058666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jejesh26","html_url":"https://github.com/jejesh26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jejesh26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jejesh26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jejesh26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jejesh26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jejesh26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jejesh26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jejesh26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jejesh26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jejesh26/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-03-11T07:30:00Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T15:30:47Z","closed_at":"2018-03-12T15:30:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Dears,\r\nGreetings from China !\r\nfirst of all thks for this wonderful tool.

It does this on the attached Dash.server instance regardless of whether the server was supplied as a param or created in `__init__`. This means that there's currently no way to opt-out of compression.\r\n\r\nApps that are concerned at all with scalability should have responses compressed by the web server (eg Apache or Nginx) as this is more efficient than having the Python process do this. We should therefore provide the ability to opt out of compression.\r\n\r\nTwo possible options:\r\n1. Have a `compress=True` param on the Dash instance, such that compression only occurs when the user creates a Dash instance as `Dash(compress=False)`\r\n2. Only perform compression on Flask instances created in `__init__` if the user did not supply a server instance.\r\n\r\nBoth options make compression the default behaviour, which I think is what we want. Of the two, I think I like 2 more, as no extra Dash param is required, and to me it makes sense that if a user has chosen to supply a server instance, they're more likely to have more advanced needs and know what they're doing.  The only disadvantage is that people with apps currently supplying their own their own servers would silently lose compression.

Development of new components would be a potentially better environment if it also supported using Flow (see, e.g., a [`material-ui` `Dialog` component](https://github.com/StratoDem/sd-material-ui/blob/master/src/components/SDDialog.react.js#L57). It would also allow faster porting of React components already written with Flow to Dash components. \r\n\r\n### Necessary pieces\r\n- [ ] The [eslint file](https://github.com/plotly/dash-components-archetype/blob/master/config/eslint/eslintrc-react.json) in `dash-components-archetype` will need to use `eslint-plugin-flowtype`\r\n- [ ] The [babelrc file](https://github.com/plotly/dash-components-archetype/blob/master/config/babel/babelrc) in `dash-components-archetype` will need to use [`transform-class-properties`](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/) in order to support `static defaultProps = {}` (not required, but would be nice), and the [`react` preset already handles stripping Flow types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-react). \r\n- [ ] `package.json` in `dash-components-archetype` would need (at least) `eslint-plugin-flowtype` and `babel-plugin-transform-class-properties`\r\n- [x] One of the following two to address the metadata: \r\n    - [x] `metadata.json` will need to be generated using the generated Flow types (matching the current structure) in `dash-components-archetype`, if they exist or \r\n    - [x] `component_loader` will need to support Flow types if they are found in the `metadata.json` and the fields generated by `PropTypes` are not found.\r\n\r\nNote that some of the code changes would occur in `dash-components-archetype`, but figured here might be a better place to discuss since the `component_loader` is the biggest \"Dash user\"-facing piece. There may also be other necessary pieces that I missed. \r\n\r\nWe've set this structure up in the [`material-ui` ports](https://github.com/StratoDem/sd-material-ui) that we're using internally for our own material Dash components, and very much like it (we're also using jest for testing and would *love* to get the Dash toolchain updated to use [React 16](https://github.com/plotly/dash-components-archetype/issues/35) since the current chain is tied to an older version of React).\r\n\r\nIf this makes sense, I can create issues specifically on `dash-components-archetype` and plan to get this out in the next couple of weeks. There should not be any breaking changes anywhere from addressing this issue. \r\n\r\nFinally: *insert flamewar about type hinting here* :smile:","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/178","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/178/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/178/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/178/events","html_url":"https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/178","id":283468872,"number":178,"title":"Image processing component - clicking on arbitrary coordinates of images","user":{"login":"farleylai","id":158540,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/158540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai","html_url":"https://github.com/farleylai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2017-12-20T07:11:02Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T17:11:20Z","closed_at":"2018-02-02T17:01:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Dash looks like the bridge between GUI and visualization. But how well does Dash (plan) support raw data such as images, audio and even video?\r\n\r\nI recently build ML models to train over image dataset. To validate the trained models, I would like to have a GUI app that allows the user to inspect image patches. So the app must capture the mouse click coordinates and feed the corresponding image patch to the model. The output image data produced by the model should be rendered on the fly along with some other computed statistics (plots or numbers). I know the HTML img tag has an attribute `ismap` to capture this. Is that well supported in Dash or are there some component widgets already available for those use cases such as image filtering, selecting a range of audio wave or video timeline to play and so on? \r\n\r\n**Afterthought**\r\n\r\nAfter going through the guide and the core/html component libraries, high level components for non-text and non-graph data are not out of the box but may be imported from other existing react components (react-cursor-position, react-wavesurfer, ...). It seems like the React component sources must be ready for customization. Is it really necessary? Why not build a platform-agnostic GUI abstraction in Python and generate the React sources only for testing and deployment time? In this sense, a web SPA is simply a target platform which the developer may not even be aware of. In the future, other mobile platforms may be supported, not to mention other potential JS UI component libraries.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/177","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/177/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/177/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plotly/dash/issues/177/events","html_url":"https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/177","id":281345959,"number":177,"title":"Initial n_clicks for a Button is None instead of 0 inside a callback","user":{"login":"Akronix","id":2631430,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2631430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akronix","html_url":"https://github.com/Akronix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akronix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akronix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akronix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akronix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akronix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akronix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akronix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akronix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akronix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-12-12T11:15:11Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T17:51:14Z","closed_at":"2017-12-12T17:01:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a Button imported from dash_html_components and I'm using it as an Input for a callback.
