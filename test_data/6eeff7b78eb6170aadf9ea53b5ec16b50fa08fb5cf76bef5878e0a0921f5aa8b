\r\n\r\nI have to resample data for my graph upon every callback. The first time the graph loads, it works fine. But as soon as it goes through its first interval, for some reason I basically lose data. When I say I lose data, I mean that at the start there will be 336 candlesticks, but upon the first update, that number drops to half and the time frame is messing up on them. I have recorded in a text file what data I am providing plotly.graph_objs.Candlestick just prior to giving it the data and it is all there every time. Something is happening with the data once I call to update the Candlestick obj. I have tried using the plotly.graph_objs.Candlestick as well as doing a dictionary with 'mode':'candlestick', and it does not solve my issue. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have tried replacing Candlestick with Scatter{'mode':'lines',...} which results in no data loss, which means it is an issue with Candlestick.

It does this on the attached Dash.server instance regardless of whether the server was supplied as a param or created in `__init__`. This means that there's currently no way to opt-out of compression.\r\n\r\nApps that are concerned at all with scalability should have responses compressed by the web server (eg Apache or Nginx) as this is more efficient than having the Python process do this. We should therefore provide the ability to opt out of compression.\r\n\r\nTwo possible options:\r\n1. Have a `compress=True` param on the Dash instance, such that compression only occurs when the user creates a Dash instance as `Dash(compress=False)`\r\n2. Only perform compression on Flask instances created in `__init__` if the user did not supply a server instance.\r\n\r\nBoth options make compression the default behaviour, which I think is what we want. Of the two, I think I like 2 more, as no extra Dash param is required, and to me it makes sense that if a user has chosen to supply a server instance, they're more likely to have more advanced needs and know what they're doing.  The only disadvantage is that people with apps currently supplying their own their own servers would silently lose compression.
