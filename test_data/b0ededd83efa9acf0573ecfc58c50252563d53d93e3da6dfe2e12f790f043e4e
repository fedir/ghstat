Update and improve the test `#bind[T]` DSL\n\nSummary: Problem\n\nThe testing `#bind[T]` DSL is lacking in its ability to be used from\nJava and we would like to rev the API to be more expressive such\nthat it also includes binding from a Type to a Type.\n\nSolution\n\nDue to wanting to also support the ability to bind a Type to a Type,\nthis was an opportunity to re-work the DSL to more closely match\nthe actual Guice binding DSL (used in the TwitterModule for users\nto be able to bind types).\n\nWith the changes, the `#bind[T]` DSL now looks as follows (for Scala users):\n\n```\nbind[T].to[U <: T]\nbind[T].to[Class[U <: T]]\nbind[T].toInstance(T)\n\nbind[T].annotatedWith[Ann].to[U <: T]\nbind[T].annotatedWith[Ann].to[Class[U <: T]]\nbind[T].annotatedWith[Ann].toInstance(T)\n\nbind[T].annotatedWith[Class[Ann]].to[U <: T]\nbind[T].annotatedWith[Class[Ann]].to[Class[U <: T]]\nbind[T].annotatedWith[Class[Ann]].toInstance(T)\n\nbind[T].annotatedWith(Annotation).to[U <: T]\nbind[T].annotatedWith(Annotation).to[Class[U <: T]]\nbind[T].annotatedWith(Annotation).toInstance(T)\n\nbindClass(Class[T]).to[T]\nbindClass(Class[T]).to[Class[U <: T]]\nbindClass(Class[T]).toInstance(T)\n\nbindClass(Class[T]).annotatedWith[Class[Ann]].to[T]\nbindClass(Class[T]).annotatedWith[Class[Ann]].[Class[U <: T]]\nbindClass(Class[T]).annotatedWith[Class[Ann]].toInstance(T)\n\nbindClass(Class[T]).annotatedWith(Annotation).to[T]\nbindClass(Class[T]).annotatedWith(Annotation).[Class[U <: T]]\nbindClass(Class[T]).annotatedWith(Annotation).toInstance(T)\n```\n\nThere are several methods for Java-compatibility as well:\n\n```\nbindClass(Class[T], T)\nbindClass(Class[T], Annotation, T)\nbindClass(Class[T], Class[Annotation], T)\n\nbindClass(Class[T], Class[U <: T])\nbindClass(Class[T],  Annotation, Class[U <: T])\nbindClass(Class[T], Class[Annotation], Class[U <: T])\n```\n\nTesting the changes in the `#bind[T]` DSL highlighted other short-\ncomings in the framework Java support, specifically around the\nability to create an injectable Flag from within a TwitterModule in\nJava (it was not easily possible).\n\nThus, the `c.t.inject.TwitterModuleFlags` has also been updated to add\n`#createFlag` and `#createMandatoryFlag` (a la the same functions in\n`c.t.app.Flags`) which doesn't require Java users to provide implicit type\nevidence but rather accepts a `Flaggable[T]` as an argument.\n\nLastly, framework tests were updated to where appropriate to use\nthe new DSL and Java examples updated to illustrate not only usage\nof the `#bind[T]` DSL in tests but also how to create a TwitterModule in\nJava and how to create injectable flags in both Module and Server\nimplementations.\n\nJIRA Issues: CSL-4217, CSL-6124, SEARCH-22552\n\nTBR=true\n\nDifferential Revision:

Update StreamingResponse with transformer and callbacks\n\nSummary: Problem\n\n`StreamingResponse` provides a simple `toBuf` serialization isn't quite powerful\nenough to generate properly formed JSON from a series of objects, requiring a\nprefix/suffix/separator to be passed in.  Furthermore, there is no way to\ntrigger any action upon the write of each object in the originating\n`AsyncStream`.\n\nSolution\n\nEnhance the `StreamingResponse` API to have a new apply constructor:\n\n* Add a `transformer` which is an `AsyncStream[T] => AsyncStream[(U, Buf)]`\n  allowing for more involved transformations and serializations rather than\n  taking `toBuf`, `prefix`, `seperator`, and `suffix`,\n\n* Add an `onWrite` which will be used to `respond` to each write of an object\n  from the transformed stream. The `onWrite` can use the `U` type in in the\n  `AsyncStream` at the end of the transformation so that onWrite can have access\n  to an abitrarily-transformed version of the original object rather than just\n  the serialized `Buf`. (For example, `T`, can be a tweet, and `U` can be a\n  tweetid).\n\n* Add an `onDisconnect` which is called when the stream disconnects in place of\n `closeOnFinish`.\n\nJIRA Issues: DSTR-4376\n\nDifferential Revision: https://phabricator.twitter.biz/D147925","tree":{"sha":"88fc70d29fafd25f3e9a6d2bb0f15f9a437a4f38","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/git/trees/88fc70d29fafd25f3e9a6d2bb0f15f9a437a4f38"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/git/commits/ab44378c426419e53c639bb6a2c29ce146f01bbe","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/commits/ab44378c426419e53c639bb6a2c29ce146f01bbe","html_url":"https://github.com/twitter/finatra/commit/ab44378c426419e53c639bb6a2c29ce146f01bbe","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/commits/ab44378c426419e53c639bb6a2c29ce146f01bbe/comments","author":{"login":"sameerparekh","id":1395413,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1395413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameerparekh","html_url":"https://github.com/sameerparekh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameerparekh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameerparekh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameerparekh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameerparekh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameerparekh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameerparekh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameerparekh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameerparekh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameerparekh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"ad4b1fb37d13ae7b27aae50b885fa4ecfd0ed105","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/commits/ad4b1fb37d13ae7b27aae50b885fa4ecfd0ed105","html_url":"https://github.com/twitter/finatra/commit/ad4b1fb37d13ae7b27aae50b885fa4ecfd0ed105"}]},{"sha":"ad4b1fb37d13ae7b27aae50b885fa4ecfd0ed105","commit":{"author":{"name":"Christopher Coco","email":"ccoco@twitter.com","date":"2018-03-19T22:38:20Z"},"committer":{"name":"jenkins","email":"jenkins@smf1-drl-17-sr1.prod.twitter.com","date":"2018-03-19T23:37:40Z"},"message":"finagle-thrift: Move stateless `ThriftRichClient` methods to a new trait\n\nSummary: Problem\n\nCertain methods in the `c.t.finagle.thrift.ThriftRichClient` are stateless\nin that they work only over the inputs, however because they are defined\non the Thrift or ThriftMux client class, they look like they work over the\nmutated params of the class, when they do not.\n\nSolution\n\nMove the stateless methods which are mere functions to wrap or convert the\ninput parameters to a companion trait which is mixed into the Client class\ncompanion.\n\nResult\n\nLess confusion about these methods which are mere convienence methods and\nnot stack methods.\n\nJIRA Issues: CSL-6108\n\nTBR=true\n\nDifferential Revision: https://phabricator.twitter.biz/D143185","tree":{"sha":"c1abed3ef36eaa131c3c21dca95d216a4b672a35","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/git/trees/c1abed3ef36eaa131c3c21dca95d216a4b672a35"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/git/commits/ad4b1fb37d13ae7b27aae50b885fa4ecfd0ed105","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/commits
