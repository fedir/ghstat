Fail startup for incorrect Controller callback functions\n\nSummary: Problem\n\nFinatra's HTTP Controller route definition expects the callback function\ninput type to be properly specified. The input type parameter needs to\nbe either:\n\n  a. `c.t.finagle.http.Request`\n  b. a \"custom\" request case class or\n  c. a type parsed by a registered message body reader\n\nOmitting or using a type that does not fall into the above categories will\ncause the route matching to fail as the `CallbackConverter` will have\npotentially infered an incorrect input type for the callback function and\nthus trigger incorrect failing behavior.\n\nSolution\n\nWhen creating and registering the routes defined in a Finatra HTTP\nController, the `CallbackConverter` should properly detect incorrectly\nspecified callback functions and fail server startup.\n\nResult\n\nEarlier signal for improperly specified HTTP Controller routes in the form\nof a server startup error.\n\nJIRA Issues:

Improve Http Nack error handling\n\nSummary: Problem\n\nThe `HttpNackFilter` converted NACK exceptions into generic\n`HttpExceptions` which could be handled by a registered\n`HttpExceptionMapper`. However, it is fairly common for users\nto register their own `HttpExceptionMapper` and it is very likely\nthat users would have no idea that they need to account specially\nfor NACK exceptions.\n\nSolution\n\nWe update to emit a specific `HttpNackException` from the\n`HttpNackFilter` and provide a default exception mapper:\n`HttpNackExceptionMapper` over that exception type which is\ndistinct from the `HttpExceptionMapper`.\n\nUsers can still override this mapper if they so choose but it\nis specific to NACKs and therefor should be clearer as to the\nbehavior that is being changed.\n\nResult\n\nIf users provide a new `ExceptionMapper[HttpException]` they will\nnot have to also account for dealing with NACK exceptions. Instead\nif users want to customize or change the default HTTP NACK\nhandling they can register a `ExceptionMapper[HttpNackException]`\nto replace the default supplied by the framework. In this way, users\ndo not lose NACK handling by just replacing the default `HttpException`\nexception mapper.\n\nJIRA Issues: CSL-6366\n\nDifferential Revision: https://phabricator.twitter.biz/D172456","tree":{"sha":"44644ec60573ccda512d6b984d3ebb5acda2e6a4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/git/trees/44644ec60573ccda512d6b984d3ebb5acda2e6a4"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/git/commits/f95bf28f3271a471d1d12852ae49c4dc26bd3144","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/commits/f95bf28f3271a471d1d12852ae49c4dc26bd3144","html_url":"https://github.com/twitter/finatra/commit/f95bf28f3271a471d1d12852ae49c4dc26bd3144","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/commits/f95bf28f3271a471d1d12852ae49c4dc26bd3144/comments","author":{"login":"cacoco","id":613046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzA0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/613046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco","html_url":"https://github.com/cacoco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"d616734365763adc8ac163b7b71bcd2384636a7f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/finatra/commits/d616734365763adc8ac163b7b71bcd2384636a7f","html_url":"https://github.com/twitter/finatra/commit/d616734365763adc8ac163b7b71bcd2384636a7f"}]},{"sha":"d616734365763adc8ac163b7b71bcd2384636a7f","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MzQ2NTMxMjpkNjE2NzM0MzY1NzYzYWRjOGFjMTYzYjdiNzFiY2QyMzg0NjM2YTdm","commit":{"author":{"name":"Yufan Gong","email":"yufang@twitter.com","date":"2018-05-11T19:47:48Z"},"committer":{"name":"jenkins","email":"jenkins@atla-atr-03-sr4.prod.twttr.net","date":"2018-05-11T20:20:45Z"},"message":"finagle-thrift{mux}: Disable client per-endpoint stats by default\n\nProblem:\nWhen building a client ServicePerEndpoint, per-endpoint stats exported for all\nendpoints, including the ones not being accessed.

Fix FinagleMDCAdapter to initialize properly\n\nSummary: Problem\n\nWe lazily initialize the mutable map backing the FinagleMDCAdapter which\nis stored in a `Local`. When that initialization happens in a scope which is\npopped when returning up the stack, the user loses any values stored in the\nmap. E.g., it is a problem if the user does something like this:\n\n```\ngetUserById(id).map { user: User =>\n  MDC.put(\"user_id\", user.id)\n  logger.info(\"Looked up user.)\n  user\n}.flatMap { user =>\n  getUserPreferences(user)\n}.flatMap { preferences =>\n  logger.info(\"Checking preferences to send notification\") // the \"user_id\" is not present here\n  // as the backing map was only created in map closure above and has fallen out of scope\n  if (preferences.sendNotification) {\n    sendNotification(preferences)\n  } else Future.Done\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, by the time the second `logger` statement is executed\nthe MDC values are lost as they were lazily created in the `MDC.put` in\nthe `#map` and have been popped from the Local context.\n\nGenerally, this has worked as users typically add one of the MDC logging\nfilters, e.g., `TraceIdMDCFilter` which incidentally creates the backing\nMDC map early enough in the stack. But this only works incidentally.\n\nSolution\n\nWe need to initialize the mutable map eagerly to ensure that the backing\nstructure is eagerly available in the `Local`.\n\nResult\n\nThe backing MDC map is created in the `LoggingMDCFilter` which does\nthe MDC initialization and thus is as early in the MDC stack as possible\nwhen means the backing map implementation should be correctly available\nwhen users transition across Future boundaries.\n\nJIRA Issues: CSL-6267\n\nTBR=true\n\nDifferential Revision:

finagle-http: Add ability to suppress ServerAC\n\nSummary: Problem\n\nServerAdmissionControl is responsible for nacking requests but it does\nso without any context as to whether the client could even retry it if\nit wanted to. For example, a HTTP client may be streaming a body from a\nReader that it didn't generate directly, so if that request gets\nnacked, there is no way to get back any data that was read during the\nfirst dispatch, and therefore the request couldn't be retried even if\nit is known the server didn't process it.\n\nSolution\n\nCreate a local context value that acts as a signal for\nServerAdmissionControl to interpret as 'this cannot be retried, so don't\nnack this request'. Since HTTP is our only protocol that suffers from this\nproperty (thus far) HTTP servers will signal that all requests that have\na body shouldn't be nacked if they are either\n1. chunked- our HTTP/1.x server requires chunked requests be consumed\n    which we can't do in the nack filter, resulting in a borked session.\n2. have a body and don't have the magic header sent by the client
