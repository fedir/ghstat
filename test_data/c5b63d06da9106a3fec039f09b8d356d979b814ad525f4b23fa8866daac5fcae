In this particular case, it was a checkbox tv that required a value and had an invalid default value (default value not in the options) and therefore always invalid. \r\n\r\nIt seems this may also require the TVs section at the bottom of the page instead of in the tab (`tvs_below_content` setting enabled), but I've not verified that yet. See below.\r\n\r\nTrying to save will mark the field in red to indicate it's required, however if that's on a different tab or way at the bottom of the page, that's near impossible to spot. The lack of a notice is definitely troubling.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be in the `failureSubmit` method on `MODx.panel.Resource`. \r\n\r\n``` js\r\n        // The next check needs the tabs index value to check if it is hidden or not\r\n        if (tabs && tabs.items && tabs.items.keys) {\r\n            tabs_index = tabs.items.keys.indexOf(tab_name);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // We are already on a tab that has an invalid state. No need to switch\r\n        if (!tabs.items.items[tabs_index].hidden)  { // <--- breaks here on accessing .hidden on undefined\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears that `tabs_index` is -1 (i.e. the current tab, `tab_name = \"modx-panel-resource-tv\"`, does not exist in the tab panel). \r\n\r\nBecause it breaks on what would normally be the tvs tab, I strongly suspect this only happens when tvs_below_content is enabled as it then no longer is a tab, but a separate panel at the bottom. \r\n\r\n### Possible fix\r\n\r\nA simple workaround would be to make sure `tabs.items.items[tabs_index]` exists before trying to access the `hidden` property. A simple check like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n if (!tabs.items.items[tabs_index] || tabs.items.items[tabs_index].hidden)  {\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat said, it's probably worthwhile figuring out if it's needed for this logic to take into account the separate TV panel below the content and perhaps open the appropriate (sub)tab there if it doesn't already do that. \r\n\r\n### Observed behavior\r\n\r\nThe error mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo error, and the `\"Please correct the errors in your form before submitting.\"` popup should show indicating a field was marked as invalid. \r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nMODX 2.7.3 on (AFAIK) any browser.

created Redmine issue ID 7484\n\nThere are several places in grid views in the MODx manager where, when right clicking on an item, the user is presented with the option to 'Update' an item. There are also many other places where a user can 'Edit' an item.\n\nUpdate can present one of at least two possible resulting actions:\n-In System Settings, 'Update Setting' presents a pop-up UI panel to edit the _setting definition_. One must double click on the value to be edited to present the UI to edit the actual value.\n-In Manage Users, 'Update User' takes the user to a new page to edit the _values_ for the user.\n\nEdit actions seem consistent in that they allow to to modify the values for the selected item.\n\nI submit that the meaning of 'Update' in unclear to describe its intended action. I think that the term 'Update' is commonly understood to mean 'Update the application's view to reflect the state of the model' that 'Allow me to Update the values for this item'. In this way, it's closer to 'Refresh' than it is to 'Edit'.\n\nWouldn't it make more sense to change all uses of 'Update' to 'Edit'? And if an 'Edit' action is going to edit something other than the item's values, perhaps that should be clarified as well, as in 'Edit Setting Definition'?\n\nI'm posting this for discussion in http://forums.modx.com/thread/75425/ui-discrepancy-between-edit-and-update-actions\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/15141","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/15141/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/15141/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/15141/events","html_url":"https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/issues/15141","id":646874534,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDY4NzQ1MzQ=","number":15141,"title":"Unknown column 'modResource.alias_visible' in 'field list'","user":{"login":"Ibochkarev","id":2138260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzgyNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2138260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ibochkarev","html_url":"https://github.com/Ibochkarev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ibochkarev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ibochkarev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ibochkarev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ibochkarev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ibochkarev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ibochkarev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ibochkarev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ibochkarev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ibochkarev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2020-06-28T08:52:02Z","updated_at":"2020-07-16T20:29:58Z","closed_at":"2020-06-29T06:53:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Bug report\r\n### Summary\r\nAfter a gradual update of СMS from version:\r\n2.5.5 -> 2.6.0 -> 2.6.5 -> 2.7.0 -> 2.7.3 an error appeared in the journal and the admin panel stopped working.

It just keeps looping in the ‘Saving…’ progress bar window.  It's happening to our dev team as well.\r\n\r\n### Step to reproduce\r\nLogin to MODX manager, create a new Resource and save it.  Seems more common with Chrome, but have observed this on FF as well.\r\n\r\n### Observed behavior\r\nIt just keeps looping in the ‘Saving…’ progress bar window.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe MODX Resource should save and the progress bar should disappear.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nMODX version: 2.6.5\r\napache/nginx and version: this is happening on our clients hosted on the MODXcloud and bitnami as well. \r\nmysql version: whatever is installed on the MODXcloud\r\nbrowser: seems common on Chrome.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/15054","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/15054/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/15054/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/15054/events","html_url":"https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/issues/15054","id":595745060,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1OTU3NDUwNjA=","number":15054,"title":"Clear system/phpthumb connector 't 'property","user":{"login":"smahelos","id":9251135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNTExMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9251135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smahelos","html_url":"https://github.com/smahelos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smahelos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smahelos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smahelos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smahelos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smahelos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smahelos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smahelos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smahelos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smahelos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":78025097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODAyNTA5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fbca04","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-04-07T09:59:05Z","updated_at":"2020-05-04T16:42:40Z","closed_at":"2020-05-04T16:42:40Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Bug report\r\n### Summary\r\nClear system/phpthumb connector property 't'\r\n\r\n### Step to reproduce\r\njust open filemanager and in log you will see error\r\n\r\n### Observed behavior\r\nin manager error log: modphpthumb.class.php : 97) Detected attempt of using private parameter `t`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nnothing in manager log\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nMODX 2.7.3, apache 2.4.39, mysql 5.7.26, google chrome latest","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
