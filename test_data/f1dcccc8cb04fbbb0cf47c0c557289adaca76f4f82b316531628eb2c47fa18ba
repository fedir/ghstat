He can plug in an existing blueprint and replace the templates from the main app if needed.\r\nThere is a different  use case however, where this behavior is unwanted and problematic. That is, when I'm structuring my applications into independent \"modules\" such that different teams can work independently on their own model/blueprint. The biggest problems is, that blueprints hits templates outside their domain, that is templates defied somewhere else in another blueprint folder. With large projects, this becomes a pretty difficult model to reason on and debug, and the blueprints are too much coupled to one another. Secondly, in this development context I would prefer a blueprint to have precedence over the base templates.\r\nIdeally, I think Flask should have an option to change the precedence of templates. For example use the current behavior by default, but introduce a new config option \"blueprints_templates_first=True/False\" to be defined somewhere (either at the app level, or for every single blueprint). The expected behavior would be the opposite of the default behavior:\r\n\r\n1. look in `app/my-blueprint/templates/` first\r\n2. look in `app/templates/` second\r\n3. **do  not** look into other blueprints folders\r\n\r\nI've seen other people come up with the same issue over the years, and I don't understand why there is so much resistance against supporting this feature. There is a real use case for this. I've always appreciated Flask because it's minimalist, concise, powerful, and doesn't get in the way I choose to structure my project. Opposing this option just seems to me as going against the nature of Flask itself, because the framework is dictating to me how I have to structure my files on disk, something that only bigger frameworks do and that Flask has proudly never done. Every workaround to this, such as adding a new inner folder `my-blueprint/templates/my-blueprint/`, just feels like a hack that goes against the ideas of simplicity and clarity.\r\n\r\nI, and I believe a lot of other Flask users as well, would really appreciate if you guys could add this configuration option to Flask.

In each application's virtualenv setup, I can set the FLASK_APP and FLASK_DEBUG environment variables so that I don't have to set them manually every time I start up the development server. However, there is no environment variable or anything of the sort to set the port, so every time I run an application, I still need to manually specify the appropriate port each time - `flask run --port 8050` instead of just `flask run`.\r\n\r\nIn #2113 joelhed wanted to use the port in the SERVER_NAME config variable, and the issue was closed on the basis that it's technically infeasible to load app config before starting up the server, which makes sense. However, a FLASK_PORT environment variable would presumably not have this problem, and it would reduce friction significantly both for people like me and joelhed (and anyone else who for any reason can't run all their Flask applications on port 5000).

I am running Raspbian Jessie. I have also tried disabling the reloader and replacing the python process with the following call:\r\n\r\n    os.execl(sys.executable, 'python', __file__, *sys.argv[1:])\r\n    \r\nThis works on Windows, however on Linux, app.run() fails on reload with \"\"Address already in use\"\" error. I have reviewed the documentation and past issues however I have not found anything specific to these symptoms. \r\n\r\nI have found that, on Linux, if I use and external script to kill the python script (pkill) and reload the script it works about half of the time. When it fails it is due the \"Address already in use\" error.\r\n\r\nI have also tried this with Watchdog and I get the same results on Linux. I have duplicated this with python 2.7.9 and 3.6.4. I am using Flask 0.12.2 \r\n\r\nIs this a known issue and if so are there any workarounds?
