have shipped iteration 2 for the Build Stages feature. \r\n\r\nAlong with a lot of bug fixes and small improvements this includes:\r\n\r\n* Build Stages section: Define the order of stages, optionally with a condition\r\n* Conditional builds, stages, jobs: Define conditions for accepting/rejecting a given build, stage, or job\r\n\r\nFind out more about this on [our blog](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2017-09-12-build-stages-order-and-conditions), and documentation [here](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-stages) and [here](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/conditional-builds-stages-jobs).\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear your feedback. Please leave all thoughts, comments, ideas related to this feature here.\r\n\r\nHappy Testing!\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n### What feature requests have you received for improving Build Stages so far?\r\n\r\nWe are adding this list of feature requests (with a rough indication of how likely we are going to prioritize it) so you don't have to ask about these again :)\r\n\r\n* Pausing a build after a given stage, and proceeding only after an interactive confirmation. (Yes)\r\n* Add a native build artifacts feature that can be used for sharing artifacts across stages, or another way to more easily share storage or artifacts. (Yes)\r\n* Making the native cache feature more configurable by specifying cache keys per job. This would allow you to reuse caches in more flexible ways in subsequent stages. (Probably yes)\r\n* Allow `script` etc. on the new `stages` section, so they can be shared across all jobs in one stage. (Yes, but not before `[1]`)\r\n* Allow specifying `allow_failure: true` per job on `jobs.include`. (Probably yes, but not before `[1]`.)\r\n* Allow a `stage` key on the `deploy` section. Turn this into a stage and a job. (Not quite sure, not before `[1]`.)\r\n* Add a name/description to jobs, in order to reveal the intend, show them in the UI. (Not quite sure.)\r\n* Consider `skip: all`, so one does not have to overwrite `before_install`, `install`, and `script`. (Sounds like a good idea? Not before `[1]`)\r\n* Silence skipped commands: no log output. (Not quite sure.) \r\n* Consider \"embedded matrix expansion\", e.g. `jobs.include.env: [FOO=foo, BAR=bar]`. (Not quite sure)\r\n* Build config `.travis.yml` editor/web tool. (Yes, based on the specification produced in `[1]`)\r\n* Allow grouping jobs into arbitrary groups, not depending on each other, like stages, just for visual presentation on the UI. (Probably not)\r\n* Update the GitHub commit status per stage, add with more detailed commit status information. (Unsure, definitely not before `[2]`)\r\n* Consider automatically restarting jobs in later stages that have been canceled because a job on a previous stage failed when this job is restarted. (So far uncertain. There's a lot of complexity involved.)\r\n* In the `running` tab, consider grouping jobs per build (and possibly stage). (Interesting thought. We are working on improving this UI, and might consider this in a later iteration.)\r\n\r\nOther improvements:\r\n\r\n* `[1]` A strict [travis-yml parser](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-yml) has been shipped.\r\n* `[2]` The GitHub commit status API has the known limitation that new updates are being rejected after the 1000th update. They are working on improving this, and providing a way for us to post more updates. Until this is unblocked we are unlikely to make any changes to our commit status updates.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique-jersey-client/issues/45","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique-jersey-client","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique-jersey-client/issues/45/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique-jersey-client/issues/45/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique-jersey-client/issues/45/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bootique/bootique-jersey-client/issues/45","id":503088113,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDMwODgxMTM=","number":45,"title":"Allow parameterized templates in mapped target \"url\"","user":{"login":"andrus","id":42668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/42668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus","html_url":"https://github.com/andrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique-jersey-client/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/bootique/bootique-jersey-client/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique-jersey-client/milestones/15/labels","id":4272864,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDI3Mjg2NA==","number":15,"title":"1.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"stariy95","id":5188210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODgyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5188210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95","html_url":"https://github.com/stariy95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":3,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-30T11:02:28Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T07:43:00Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-11-27T07:43:00Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-10-06T11:30:33Z","updated_at":"2019-10-06T11:33:06Z","closed_at":"2019-10-06T11:33:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Change `WebTargetFactory.url` to String from URI to support templates like `http://127.0.0.1:8080/r1/{p1}?name={p2}`.
