I'll explain the situation below, feel free to let me know if there are ways to implement this behavior, currently the documentation links are down. \r\n\r\nIn case if it doesn't exist, I would appreciate if we could implement it. Because otherwise it is currently not possible for one to write maintainable integration tests for `glimmerx` when they `npm their way to ember from glimmer`:\r\n\r\nIntention:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { module, test } from 'qunit';\r\nimport { render } from 'emberx/test-helpers';\r\nimport { setupRenderingTest } from 'emberx/test-helpers/setup';\r\n\r\nimport LinkTo from '../../src/components/LinkTo'; // NOTE: imported component to test\r\n\r\nmodule('Integration | <LinkTo />', function (hooks) {\r\n  setupRenderingTest(hooks);\r\n\r\n  test('it works for a basic route without params', async function (assert) {\r\n    await render('<LinkTo @route=\"public.index\">Go to homepage</LinkTo>', LinkTo); // NOTE: currently 2nd argument needed unfortunately, explained below\r\n\r\n    assert.dom('.ember-testing a').hasText('Go to homepage');\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nImplementation and the roadblock(s):\r\n```ts\r\n// in package: emberx/src/test-helpers/index.js:\r\n\r\nimport GlimmerComponent, { hbs } from '@glimmerx/component';\r\nimport { renderComponent } from '@glimmerx/core';\r\nimport { getContext } from './context';\r\n\r\nexport function render(\r\n  template: string,\r\n  component: GlimmerComponent, // NOTE: normally we shouldn't need it if we could build an existing Component registry\r\n  services: object | undefined\r\n): Promise<any> {\r\n  const context = getContext(); // NOTE: this just returns 'this' context of the test where its used\r\n  const targetServices = context.services || services; // NOTE: this render API should be usable without implicit resolvers, thus needs an explicit way to set services context\r\n\r\n  // testing something out:\r\n  window.hbs = hbs`<LinkTo @route=\"something\">Another</LinkTo>`; // NOTE: hbs is just a token currently, a precompile transpiler token, a babel plugin/addon \r\n  // thus no way to get an analysis of the dynamically provided template string in the `render(template)` argument.\r\n  // we need that/or another function to return an AST with passed arguments, \r\n  // yield references as JS object when an hbs string is provided. \r\n  // Imported components inside the strings should be tokenized/included in the AST as well, somehow...\r\n \r\n  console.log('template is', template);

Description\r\n\r\nI was doing some experiments with using RIOT on the HiFive1 board with a SLIP network peripheral. For this purpose, I used the `gnrc_minimal` example application and slightly modified its `Makefile` to use a static IPv6 address via SLIP (let me know if you need the exact configuration).\r\n\r\nAfter some tests I ran into the following assertion:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f9c3e5f5a497f1214ca169a3eb0910e7bc4d19e7/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/nib/nib.c#L295\r\n\r\nHere is a backtrace which I obtained using GDB:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#0  core_panic (crash_code=crash_code@entry=PANIC_ASSERT_FAIL, message=0x2040ea98 <assert_crash_message> \"FAILED ASSERTION.\") at /home/soeren/src/RIOT/core/panic.c:65\r\n#1  0x20402020 in gnrc_ipv6_nib_handle_pkt (netif=netif@entry=0x0, ipv6=<optimized out>, icmpv6=icmpv6@entry=0x80001a90 <_pktbuf+64>, icmpv6_len=<optimized out>)\r\n    at /home/soeren/src/RIOT/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/nib/nib.c:295\r\n#2  0x2040b0f8 in gnrc_icmpv6_demux (netif=netif@entry=0x0, pkt=pkt@entry=0x80001a50 <_pktbuf>) at /home/soeren/src/RIOT/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/icmpv6/gnrc_icmpv6.c:104\r\n#3  0x2040164c in _demux (nh=58, pkt=0x80001a50 <_pktbuf>, netif=0x0) at /home/soeren/src/RIOT/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/gnrc_ipv6.c:121\r\n#4  _receive (pkt=0x80001a50 <_pktbuf>) at /home/soeren/src/RIOT/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/gnrc_ipv6.c:901\r\n#5  _event_loop (args=<optimized out>) at /home/soeren/src/RIOT/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/gnrc_ipv6.c:201\r\n#6  0x20400520 in sched_switch (other_prio=3) at /home/soeren/src/RIOT/core/sched.c:263\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the `netif` pointer, as passed to the `_demux` function, is `NULL` and `gnrc_ipv6_nib_handle_pkt` (called later with this pointer) requires is to be non-`NULL`.\r\n\r\nThe `netif` pointer is declared in the `_receive` function of `gnrc_ipv6` as follows:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/3b6fa61829ede55982ce057cbcf6dc205ed7cbfb/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/gnrc_ipv6.c#L641\r\n\r\nThere are two functions which may assign a value to it. The first is the invocation of `gnrc_netif_hdr_get_netif`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/3b6fa61829ede55982ce057cbcf6dc205ed7cbfb/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/gnrc_ipv6.c#L737-L740\r\n\r\nHowever, the `gnrc_netif_raw` interface used by `slipdev` does not include a `GNRC_NETTYPE_NETIF` protocol type in the packet. For this reason, `gnrc_netif_hdr_get_netif` is never invoked when using SLIP. The other function which may assign a value to `netif` is `_pkt_not_for_me` as invoked from `_receive` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/3b6fa61829ede55982ce057cbcf6dc205ed7cbfb/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/gnrc_ipv6.c#L839\r\n\r\nHowever, if `_pkt_not_for_me` returns `false` no value is assigned to `netif`. Nonetheless, `_demux` will be invoked even if `_pkt_not_for_me` returned false. If so, `netif` is NULL and `_demux` will later call `gnrc_ipv6_nib_handle_pkt` with this `NULL` pointer (see the backtrace above).\r\n\r\nIf needed I can try to assemble a sample packet, however, I believe this writeup to be more useful to reproduce the bug.  The following change keeps the assertion from failing, but it's probably not a good fix:\r\n\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/nib/nib.c b/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/nib/nib.c\r\nindex bb332d70e..fb5f6201c 100644\r\n--- a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/nib/nib.c\r\n+++ b/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/ipv6/nib/nib.c\r\n@@ -292,6 +292,8 @@ void gnrc_ipv6_nib_handle_pkt(gnrc_netif_t *netif, const ipv6_hdr_t *ipv6,\r\n                               const icmpv6_hdr_t *icmpv6, size_t icmpv6_len)\r\n {\r\n     DEBUG(\"nib: Handle packet (icmpv6->type = %u)\\n\", icmpv6->type);\r\n+    if (netif == NULL)\r\n+      return;\r\n     assert(netif != NULL);\r\n     gnrc_netif_acquire(netif);\r\n     _nib_acquire();\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected results\r\n\r\nRIOT shouldn't crash.\r\n\r\n#### Actual results\r\n\r\nFailed assertion in `gnrc_ipv6_nib_handle_pkt`.\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\n\r\nGiven the write-up above I don't think this is needed.

So the issue seems just to be with messages printed very near in time to initialization.\r\n\r\nThis could be a Tock problem or a tockloader problem, I have not looked into it further.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-web/issues/15265","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-web","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-web/issues/15265/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-web/issues/15265/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-web/issues/15265/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/15265","id":707582557,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MDc1ODI1NTc=","number":15265,"title":"Webpack dev build compiles with warnings now","user":{"login":"turt2live","id":1190097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTAwOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1190097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turt2live","html_url":"https://github.com/turt2live","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turt2live/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turt2live/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turt2live/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turt2live/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turt2live/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turt2live/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turt2live/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turt2live/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turt2live/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":254874936,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ4NzQ5MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-web/labels/p3","name":"p3","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"t3chguy","id":2403652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDM2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2403652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy","html_url":"https://github.com/t3chguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"t3chguy","id":2403652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDM2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2403652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy","html_url":"https://github.com/t3chguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chguy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:25:17Z","updated_at":"2020-09-28T15:47:16Z","closed_at":"2020-09-28T15:47:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"\n```\n2020-09-23 12:24:21.845 [riot-js]\n2020-09-23 12:24:21.845 [riot-js] WARNING in GenerateSW has been called multiple times, perhaps due to running webpack in --watch mode.

Describe your issue:\r\nUnmounting (with keepRootElement true) and then remounting a component with a spread operator applied to it within a sub-level mounted component causes issues on this.update() after re mounting utilizing mount()\r\n\r\n2. Can you reproduce the issue?\r\nI cannot reproduce the issue in the in-browser compilation version, but I've reproduced **similar** code at the top level in the following plunkr. The issue seems to occur within the CLI version.\r\n[This works but only in-browser compilation for me](https://plnkr.co/edit/2Ym1rfF5SdcHI1IZ)\r\nI was able to hack around the issue by utilizing the following steps:\r\na) create an arbitrary array with length 1\r\nb) wrapped the child component (which is a recursive tree wrapper) within it. \r\nc) removed the number from the array\r\nd) running this.update() to \"unmount\" dynamically (rather than importing unmount and trying to use the built in function)\r\ne) Unregister, re-register user updated components (purpose of the app) - see [here](https://predictabilityisgood.github.io/blockform/) for context. review form tab for tree hierarchy, then block to modify template and watch the tags get dynamically unmounted=>unregistered=>reregistered=>mounted\r\nf) added the arbitrary number back to the arraybuilt-in function)\r\ng) run this.update()  to \"mount\" dynamically (rather than importing mount and trying to use the built-in function)\r\n\r\n3.
