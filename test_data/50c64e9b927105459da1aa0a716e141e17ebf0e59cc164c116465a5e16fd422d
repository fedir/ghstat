Description 📖 \r\n\r\nUsing pattern matching makes the `call` algorithm very elegant and robust in terms of type checking, but as a result Ruby versions lower than `2.7.0` are not supported.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this means that `hanami-api` can't be used with [_TruffleRuby_](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby), which at the moment [doesn't have plans to support `2.7.0`](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/2004), as well as other Ruby implementations.\r\n\r\n### Performance and Adoption 🚀 \r\n\r\nTo improve the adoption of `hanami-api`, it might be nice to [avoid pattern matching](https://github.com/ElMassimo/api/commits/master) at the moment despite of the uglier implementation, which would allow to use it in non-MRI rubies as well as older Ruby versions.\r\n\r\nRan the benchmarks in `r10k`, and there doesn't seem to be a significant difference in performance, which is good (the modified version was slightly faster and used slightly less memory when I tested it).\r\n\r\n### Question ❔ \r\n\r\nIs the Ruby 2.7.0 choice related to the [delegation problem](https://eregon.me/blog/2019/11/10/the-delegation-challenge-of-ruby27.html)?","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev/issues/4580","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev/issues/4580/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev/issues/4580/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev/issues/4580/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev/issues/4580","id":487820605,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0ODc4MjA2MDU=","number":4580,"title":"[MAS-Art]

So, ActiveSupport is available, but the Inflector isn't used for the normal application. (It _is_ used for their CLI, but that's not being loaded here.)\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that, when Hanami uses a repository, it calls [`Dry::Core::Inflector.camelize(name)` through ROM](https://github.com/rom-rb/rom/blob/v3.3.3/lib/rom/configuration_dsl/relation.rb#L16).\r\n\r\nBy itself, this should be fine, but `Dry::Core::Inflector` attempts to load 3 different back-end engines, in this order: `ActiveSupport::Inflector`, `Dry::Inflector`, `Inflecto`. \r\n\r\nIt first tries to require `ActiveSupport::Inflector`, which in this case succeeds, since `activesupport` is loaded. But, I don't actually want to load that :)\r\n\r\nOne way I was able to fix this was to change the order so `dry-inflector` is first, and add that to my `Gemfile`. This solves my problem, but I don't think we should be loading `ActiveSupport::Inflector` automatically. Some people use `ActiveSupport` without monkey patching, and we should encourage that. Maybe we could leverage it if it's already loaded, but not require it automatically here? \r\n\r\nRelated: \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-core/pull/8\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/skylightio/skylight-ruby/issues/121 I originally thought this was a bug in `skylight-ruby`, but it's a bug in `dry-core`.\r\n\r\nHappy to open a PR for this, just want to get everyone's thoughts before I move forward. I know this is an issue with ROM 3, since ROM 4 uses `rom-support`'s `Inflector`, which is actually the apparent predecessor to the `dry-core` version I'm talking about now.

$(\".js-foo\").click (e) ->\r\n    e.preventDefault()\r\n    console.log(\"clicked\")\r\n    $.get\r\n      url: \"/foo\"\r\n      success: (a,b,c) ->\r\n        console.log(\"GET success via jQuery\", JSON.stringify(a),JSON.stringify(b), JSON.stringify(c))\r\n        $(document.body).append(\"<p>AJAX done</p>\")\r\n      error: (a,b,c) -> console.log(\"error\", a,b,c)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `/foo` endpoint is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef foo\r\n  puts \"about to return 123\"\r\n  render json: { number: 123 }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat we're seeing is that most of the time, the spec says\r\n\r\n```\r\nlog: clicked\r\nabout to return 123\r\nlog: GET success via jQuery \"\" \"success\" {\"readyState\":4,\"responseText\":\"\",\"status\":200,\"statusText\":\"OK\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it fires the Ajax request, the controller says \"about to return 123\", but jQuery only sees an empty-string response text.\r\n\r\nSometimes (maybe once in 5-10 spec runs or so?) it does what we wanted, saying\r\n\r\n```\r\nlog: clicked\r\nabout to return 123\r\nlog: GET success via jQuery {\"number\":123} \"success\" {\"readyState\":4,\"responseText\":\"{\\\"number\\\":123}\",\"responseJSON\":{\"number\r\n\":123},\"status\":200,\"statusText\":\"OK\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we add `dataType: \"json\"` to the jQuery AJAX request, it also fails sometimes and passes sometimes, with slightly different messages, but it seems to amount to the same thing – it gets an empty-string response sometimes, which then can't be parsed as JSON.\r\n\r\nWe used jQuery in this simplified example, but the real project uses AngularJS's $http (it's an old project that we're modernising, starting with the tests), and runs into the same issue, so I'm guessing this applies to all Ajax requests.\r\n\r\nAny ideas what could be going on here, that could cause Ajax requests to respond with an empty string, even though the server seems to provide the correct response?","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hanami/hanami/issues/1026","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hanami/hanami","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hanami/hanami/issues/1026/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hanami/hanami/issues/1026/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hanami/hanami/issues/1026/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hanami/hanami/issues/1026","id":544772505,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NDQ3NzI1MDU=","number":1026,"title":"EAV
