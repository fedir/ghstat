The [result](https://hstspreload.org/?domain=luckyframework.org) is the same for Lucky's site:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-09-22 20-12-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2916331/93870026-fbdb2000-fd0f-11ea-9f0a-14ecb088cc6a.png)\r\n\r\nThe information provided in that message and the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security#Description:~:text=Note%3A%20The%20Strict%2DTransport%2DSecurity%20header%20is%20ignored,and%20will%20honor%20the%20Strict%2DTransport%2DSecurity%20header.) (which are linked to [from the Lucky docs, ironically](https://luckyframework.org/guides/http-and-routing/security-headers#forcing-ssl-and-hsts)) says that the HSTS header needs to be provided when the site is requested over HTTPS only. Which makes sense, as an HTTP request could be tampered with to remove the header.\r\n\r\nI checked what the current behaviour is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜ curl -I luckyframework.org         \r\nHTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect\r\nServer: Cowboy\r\nDate: Tue, 22 Sep 2020 09:55:19 GMT\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31104000; includeSubDomains\r\nLocation:

SameSite=Lax\r\nVia: 1.1 vegur\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the `Strict-Transport-Security` was present in the wrong response.\r\n\r\nFixing it should be relatively simple, even for a Crystal-newbie like myself, so I'll start on a PR now.\r\n\r\nbtw, you folks really should provide info on somewhere to report security vulnerabilities =P e.g. https://securitytxt.org/\r\n\r\nCheers for the awesome
