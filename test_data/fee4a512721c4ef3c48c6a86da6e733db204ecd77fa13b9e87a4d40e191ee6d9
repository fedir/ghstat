This is because the test command for webpack still uses the deprecated `--opts ../../../mocha.opts` argument (additinally that file was removed in https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge/commit/83bfe97136fa3912a657ec9f173dee514e65894f).\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nYour best chance of getting this bug looked at quickly is to provide a MINIMAL REPOSITORY that can be cloned and run. Also include:\r\n* if you are using the `electron-packager` CLI: the command line arguments you are passing\r\n* if you are using the API the parameters are you passing to the `packager()` function\r\n-->\r\n* Follow https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#changing-the-code\r\n* cd into `electron-forge/packages/plugin/webpack`\r\n* run `bolt test`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n**Test Command**: `mocha --require ts-node/register test/**/*_spec.ts test/**/**/*_spec.ts --opts ../../../mocha.opts`\r\n\r\n**Error**:\r\n```\r\n✖ ERROR: --opts: configuring Mocha via 'mocha.opts' is DEPRECATED and no longer supported.\r\n          Please use a configuration file instead.\r\nerror Error\r\nerror     at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (/home/iboyperson/.local/share/yarn/global/node_modules/bolt/dist/modern/utils/processes.js:128:16)\r\nerror     at ChildProcess.emit (node:events:327:20)\r\nerror     at maybeClose (node:internal/child_process:1048:16)\r\nerror     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (node:internal/child_process:288:5)\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n* Console output when you run your `electron-forge` command with the environment variable\r\n  `DEBUG=electron-forge:*`.

Please include the stack trace if\r\n  one exists.\r\n* Command line arguments you are passing to `electron-forge` (e.g.,\r\n  `electron-forge make --not-a-real-flag`)\r\n* The `config.forge` data in `package.json` or `forge.config.js` in use\r\n* A failing minimal testcase (with a link to the code) or detailed steps to reproduce the problem.\r\n  Using `electron-forge init` is a good starting

#1734 has a large discussion that seems to cloud the actual problem, I decided to open a new issue. But it is effectively a duplicate.\r\n\r\nWe had the same issue... Diving very deep in the Bolt-internals, I found the cause.\r\n\r\nIt is related to caching, but not the cache specifically.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bolt/core/blob/b2aba74de9ca50d392e38ac77f3881f83e319e23/src/Repository/FieldRepository.php#L134\r\n\r\nWith that `get_declared_classes`-call it is assumed all Field-classes are loaded at this time. This happens to be true when the cache is not yet defined, probably due having to create the entity/field-configuration. But is an incorrect assumption when the cache is used. \r\n\r\nIn our case, the amount of declared classes at that time drops from 2270 to 1140.\r\nThe only Field-class during that call to get_declared_classes is the generic Field-class, none of its subclasses is available. \r\n\r\nAs such, this has incorrect behavior for all fields, not just the TemplateselectField. The TemplateselectField's Twig-template just happens to use helper methods with typehints. And those cause fatal errors.\r\n\r\nA quick-fix for Bolt-specific fields would be to first test wheter `'Bolt\\\\Entity\\\\' . $classname` exists (and implements that interface).

updating from Bolt 4.0 to 4.1, there seems to be an SQL bug affecting retrieval and listing of all blocks from the database. Individual Blocks can still be added and edited, but the listing of existing Blocks cannot be browsed. The following error is thrown:\r\n\r\n`SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'TEXT)) ASC) dctrn_result) dctrn_table' at line 1`\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n| Question          |   Answer                              |\r\n|----------------- | ------------------------------|      \r\n| Bolt Version     |   4.1                                     |\r\n| Install type       |  Composer install                |\r\n| BC Break          |  No                                      |\r\n| PHP version     |  7.4.4                                    |\r\n| Web server      |  Apache (version 2.4.35)      |\r\n| Database         |  MySQL (version 5.7.24)      |\r\n| Environment    |  Local Development            |\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n---------------------\r\n### Bug summary\r\nSQL error is thrown when executing `SELECT COUNT(*) AS dctrn_count FROM (SELECT DISTINCT id_0 FROM (SELECT b0_.id AS id_0, b0_.content_type AS content_type_1, b0_.status AS status_2, b0_.created_at AS created_at_3, b0_.modified_at AS modified_at_4, b0_.published_at AS published_at_5, b0_.depublished_at AS depublished_at_6 FROM bolt_content b0_ LEFT JOIN bolt_field b1_ ON b0_.id = b1_.content_id AND b1_.type IN ('generic', 'block', 'checkbox', 'collection', 'data', 'date', 'email', 'embed', 'file', 'filelist', 'hidden', 'html', 'image', 'imagelist', 'markdown', 'number', 'select', 'set', 'slug', 'templateselect', 'textarea', 'text', 'article', 'redactor') LEFT JOIN bolt_field_translation b2_ ON b1_.id = b2_.translatable_id WHERE b0_.content_type = ?

Since a global middleware is already enabled for this, there doesn't appear to be a way to purposefully react to bot events.\r\n\r\nLooking through the code, I don't see any reason that this middleware should be required so it shouldn't break things to turn it off but I am not sure how to do that.\r\n\r\nThe use case is for `member_joined_channel` events. The app I am working on lets users pick a channel for the bot to work in and then, as expected, the bot is unable to post to that channel until it is invited so I need to monitor for the bot being invited to the channel.\r\n\r\nI configured a simple function (`@app.event(\"member_left_channel\")`) to watch for these events but the aforementioned middleware prevents them from being executed.\r\n\r\n### Category (place an `x` in each of the `[ ]`)\r\n\r\n* [x] **slack_bolt.App** and/or its core components\r\n* [ ] **slack_bolt.async_app.AsyncApp** and/or its core components\r\n* [ ] Adapters in **slack_bolt.adapter**\r\n* [x] Others\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nPlease read the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-python/blob/main/.github/contributing.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://slackhq.github.io/code-of-conduct) before creating this issue or pull request.
