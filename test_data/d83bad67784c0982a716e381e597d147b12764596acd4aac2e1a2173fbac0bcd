The former is a bit more\ndifficult because it fundamentally changes the way how middlewares are added.\nIf you currently try to run the Ramaze tests using Innate HEAD you'll get all\nsorts of crazy error messages.\n\nAs I announced in the last release Email I don't really plan on keeping this\nrelease backwards compatible. However, if it isn't too much trouble and doesn't\nrequire too much code it might be worth looking into. See \nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/ramaze/wjcush4_JCI for \nthe release Email.\n\nOnce this issue has been addressed I'll send out an Email to the mailing list\nand I want to wait around a month to give people some time to prepare. Thus\ndepending on whether or not we get any work done this or next weekend I want to\npush out a new Ramaze release around the end of August.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/48","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/48/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/48/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/48/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/48","id":5235704,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MjM1NzA0","number":48,"title":"Ramaze is caching the controller output","user":{"login":"desbest","id":1139316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1139316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desbest","html_url":"https://github.com/desbest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desbest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desbest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desbest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desbest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desbest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desbest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desbest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desbest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desbest/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-06-24T13:32:58Z","updated_at":"2012-06-24T14:48:00Z","closed_at":"2012-06-24T14:48:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This seems like a bug and not a how-to question, so I'm posting it here.\nBelow is a gif animation I made, so you can see this caching problem for yourself.\n\nKeep in mind that I have to refresh the page an EXTRA time, to have the appropriate layout to be displayed by the controller.

BlueForm causes Rack to wet itself whenever the method input_checkbox is used.\nThe problem is caused because BlueForm creates a hidden field with the name of the checkbox \nfield but as a string, rather than an array. This means that if your field is named \"foobar\" you'd get\nthe following HTML:\n\n```\n<input name=\"foobar\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"0\" />\n<input name=\"foobar[]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"1\" />\n<input name=\"foobar[]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"2\" />\n```\n\nThis confuses Rack as it sees 3 fields with the same name but the first one is a\nstring based value, not an array. This results in the following errors:\n\n```\nE [2011-07-25 09:18:12 $16794] ERROR | : undefined method `empty?' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)\n(erb):190:in `pretty'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/erb.rb:753:in `eval'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/erb.rb:753:in `result'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/rack-1.2.2/lib/rack/showexceptions.rb:65:in `pretty'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/rack-1.2.2/lib/rack/showexceptions.rb:26:in `rescue in call'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/rack-1.2.2/lib/rack/showexceptions.rb:24:in `call'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/rack-1.2.2/lib/rack/commonlogger.rb:18:in `call'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/rack-1.2.2/lib/rack/lint.rb:48:in `_call'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/rack-1.2.2/lib/rack/lint.rb:36:in `call'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/innate-2011.04/lib/innate/middleware_compiler.rb:52:in `call'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/rack-1.2.2/lib/rack/content_length.rb:13:in `call'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/rack-1.2.2/lib/rack/handler/webrick.rb:52:in `service'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/httpserver.rb:111:in `service'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/httpserver.rb:70:in `run'\n/Users/yorickpeterse/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/server.rb:183:in `block in start_thread'\n```\n\nSimply adding [] to the name does not work as that means the field is _always_\nsubmitted even though a custom value may be set. Below are several possible\nworkarounds.\n\n```\n<!-- Not sure if this is actually allowed according to the HTTP spec -->\n<input name=\"foobar[default]\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"0\" />\n<input name=\"foobar[]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"1\" />\n<input name=\"foobar[]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"2\" /\n\n<!-- Requires some extra work -->\n<input name=\"foobar_default\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"0\" />\n<input name=\"foobar[]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"1\" /> \n<input name=\"foobar[]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"2\" /\n```\n\nAnother, and probably easier way, is to simply remove the hidden fields for the input_checkbox and input_radio methods as they're somewhat useless anyway.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/17","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/17/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/17/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/17/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/17","id":1256820,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMjU2ODIw","number":17,"title":"\"Themes\"

finally creating an issue about this, I plan to use Ramaze for every site/webapp I work on.\n\nI'd like to be able to setup sites that allow people to change the theme of the site, like how XenForo, IPB, etc allow each user to use a different theme.\n\nI've done this with some code that looks something like this, in my app controller:\n\n```\ndef set_theme(theme)\n  if action.view and File.exists?(realpath + \"/themes/#{theme}/\" + action.view.gsub(realpath + '/themes/default/', ''))\n    action.view = realpath + \"/themes/#{theme}/\" + action.view.gsub(realpath + '/themes/default/', '')\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThere's a little more to it, such as setting the layouts directory, but you hopefully get the idea. I've basically had to try and replace the view path with my own.\n\nI'm hoping it's possible to have a built in function that allows this. I know there's a way to change the paths with\n\n```\nRamaze.options.layouts = [\"themes/default/layouts\"]\nRamaze.options.views = [\"themes/default\"]\n```\n\nBut the problem with this is, is that these changes only work on the _next_ request, and not just for one user.\n\nI hope I'm explaining this right. Basically, I'd like to  be able to use a function in my controller's initialize or action methods to change the view directories for the _current_ request, for example:\n\n```\ndef initialize\n  set :view_path => \"themes/default\"\n  set :layout_path => \"themes/default/layouts\"\nend\n```\n\nThank you for your time.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/16","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/16/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/16/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/16/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Ramaze/ramaze/issues/16","id":1256743,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMjU2NzQz","number":16,"title":"Ramaze executable","user":{"login":"YorickPeterse","id":86065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/86065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorickPeterse","html_url":"https://github.com/YorickPeterse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorickPeterse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorickPeterse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorickPeterse/gists{/gist_id}","s
