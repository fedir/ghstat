In short:\n- During cache warmup, a Twig cache warmer caches all available templates\n- When twig is initialized, its extensions are initialized as well\n- CMF Twig extensions (like the one in CoreBundle and CreateBundle) depend on Doctrine\n- When Doctrine is initialized, it fetches the PHPCR workspace\n- Fetching the PHPCR workspace results in an error, as the database is not yet initialized\n\nI have no idea which dependency is causing this new error, as it seems like all things are around for years. Also, trying older versions of the related packages doesn't fix the error.\n\nThis problem is very relevant when using the CMF SE or Sandbox. During installation, the Composer hooks are executed. One of these hooks clears the cache. In order to clear the cache, the application first needs to be initialized. This means that the cache is build and building the cache is exactly the problem on a fresh install, as there is no database.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea on how to fix this? Catching \"table not found\" exceptions in all twig-related services (and who knows which other services will be used during warm-up in the feature?) doesn't sound quite nice. Initializing the database in a composer hook doesn't sound nice either.\n\nAlso, I wondering why this error is happening now and not 2 years ago.

This becomes more and more of a problem, see for example https://github.com/symfony-cmf/RoutingBundle/pull/292\n\nIf we split the admin out into their own bundle, we can properly manage dependencies without worrying about the impact on users that do not need sonata at all. This would allow to provide admins for different versions of sonata, and will a better solution when admins for other systems than sonata are developped.\n\nWe can keep the namespaces as they are, making the only BC break (if that is to be called a BC break) that users of sonata admin need depend on the new bundle(s) in addition to the sonata admin.\n\nOptions:\n## One bundle CmfSonataPhpcrAdminBundle\n\nI would suggest that this covers only the bundles that are included in symfony-cmf/symfony-cmf\n### Pro\n- Less separate repositories, less confusion\n- Possibility to share code between admins\n### Con\n- How to model dependency on feature bundle?
