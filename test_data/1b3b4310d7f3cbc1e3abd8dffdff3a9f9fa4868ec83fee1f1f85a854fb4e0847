Note that `debug` mode is run like this `lando command -vvv`. Paste in the error and the `~100` lines that proceeded it.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndockerpycreds.errors.InitializationError: docker-credential-desktop not installed or not available in PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Tell us generally about your bug**\r\n\r\ni tried to use the default config from lando documentation, and i used the same step, but it didn't work\r\n\r\n**Tell us more**\r\n\r\nCould better documentation have prevented this issue? if so what should we change?\r\nDoes this bug prevent you from using lando?\r\n\r\ni don't think so, because no info can be found on  the requested `docker-credential-desktop` resource/program \r\n\r\n**solution**\r\n\r\nafter searching, i found out that this error can be fixed by adding `\"credsStore\" : \"osxkeychain\"`\r\nin `~/.docker/config.json` file which become:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"stackOrchestrator\" : \"swarm\",\r\n  \"credsStore\" : \"osxkeychain\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut generally thanks for your effort and
