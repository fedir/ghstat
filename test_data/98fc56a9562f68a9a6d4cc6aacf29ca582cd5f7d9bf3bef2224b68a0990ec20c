New sessions and channels are always added to `ws-clients`, but never removed, what makes it grow over time.\r\n2. In the function associated with `:on-text` in `ws-paths`, we know what is the message, but we don't know which session sent it.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run this example https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/jetty-web-sockets\r\n2. In REPL observe @ws-clients as clients connect and disconnect\r\n\r\n## My workaround\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I'd like to say that I'm a clojure amateur, so my solution may totally be flawed. I'd like to present it anyways, just to illustrate where I was heading, as well as get your opinion whether this makes any sense. \r\n\r\nIn my project I decided to provide a custom `:listener-fn`, like this:\r\n```clojure\r\n:context-configurator #(add-ws-endpoints % ws-paths {:listener-fn ws-listener}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ws-listener` passes the Session object to all the functions:\r\n```clojure\r\n(ns ...\r\n  (:require ...\r\n            [io.pedestal.http.jetty.websockets :refer [start-ws-connection]])\r\n  (:import [org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.api Session WebSocketAdapter]))\r\n\r\n;; ...\r\n\r\n(defn ws-listener\r\n  [_request _response ws-map]\r\n  (proxy [WebSocketAdapter] []\r\n    (onWebSocketConnect [^Session ws-session]\r\n      (proxy-super onWebSocketConnect ws-session)\r\n      (when-let [f (:on-connect ws-map)]\r\n        (f ws-session)))\r\n    (onWebSocketClose [status-code reason]\r\n      (when-let [f (:on-close ws-map)]\r\n        (f (.getSession this) status-code reason)))\r\n    (onWebSocketError [^Throwable e]\r\n      (when-let [f (:on-error ws-map)]\r\n        (f (.getSession this) e)))\r\n    (onWebSocketText [^String message]\r\n      (when-let [f (:on-text ws-map)]\r\n        (f (.getSession this) message)))\r\n    (onWebSocketBinary [^bytes payload offset length]\r\n      (when-let [f (:on-binary ws-map)]\r\n        (f (.getSession this) payload offset length)))))\r\n```\r\nAnd here's a snippet illustrating what it enables me to:\r\n```clojure\r\n(def ws-clients (atom {}))\r\n\r\n(defn get-session-id [ws-session]\r\n  (-> ws-session\r\n      .getRequestURI\r\n      .getQuery\r\n      route/parse-query-string\r\n      :session))\r\n\r\n(defn new-ws-client\r\n  [ws-session send-ch]\r\n  (let [sess (get-session-id ws-session)]\r\n    (swap! ws-clients assoc sess send-ch)))\r\n    ;; here you may want to do something in response to the new connection\r\n\r\n(def ws-paths\r\n  {\"/ws\" {:on-connect (start-ws-connection new-ws-client)\r\n          :on-text (fn [sess msg] (receive-message! (get-session-id sess) msg))\r\n          :on-binary (fn [sess payload offset length] (log/info :msg \"Binary Message!\" :bytes payload))\r\n          :on-error (fn [sess t] (log/error :msg \"WS Error happened\" :exception t))\r\n          :on-close (fn [sess num-code reason-text]\r\n                      (swap! ws-clients dissoc (get-session-id sess))\r\n                      (handle-disconnection! (get-session-id sess)))}})\r\n```\r\nAll the functions start like `(fn [sess `, where `sess` is the WebSocket Session object form Jetty.\r\nWhen a client disconnects, I can `dissoc` the corresponding channel from `ws-clients`. \r\nAlso, when a message arrives, I know exactly which client sent it, what's crucial to my business logic. \r\n\r\n**What do you think?

there,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thanks to all of the maintainers and contributors for building and open sourcing lacinia. It's been a pleasure to work with so far.\r\n\r\nWe're using lacinia for a GraphQL server and are interested in composing it together with some other GraphQL servers with something like the [Apollo Gateway](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-gateway/) and [federated services](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/). It appears that the Apollo team has put together [a spec](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/federation-spec/) to make composing services into a gateway, without the need to stitch together remote schemas.\r\n\r\nI was curious if this was on your radar and how you see lacinia providing this functionality, should a team using lacinia need to add their service to a gateway?

Thanks to Colen for designing it, https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT-New-Horizons-Modpack/issues/6172! So Prometheus asked me to make an issue to collect any proposed changes and additions. This goes from typos to major changes and new quests. I'll start with my own observations below.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that in the end its up to Colen, Prometheus, & the devs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Remove the UEV circuit from the circuit quest 'these exist?' as that one has its own quest in the UHV tab now.\r\n\r\n- The quest for a filled really ultimate battery is just silly and should be removed. I am confident Colen did not do the maths. Just in terms of energy production, even if you have 10 mk3 fusion reactors running permanently just for filling the battery, giving you 150M eu/t with infinity turbines which would be a more powerful setup than anybody has ever done to my knowledge, then it would still take about 100 actual real life years to fill. (also discussed in https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT-New-Horizons-Modpack/issues/6205)\r\n\r\n- Adding a quest for just the ultimate battery would be a good stepping stone to the really ultimate one\r\n\r\n- The ultimate capacitor (kekztech) is now just a simple assembler recipe away from the really ultimate battery, so maybe not quite worth its own quest, but at least it should be mentioned in the quest for the really ultimate battery (extra quest is also fine of course)\r\n\r\n- Also add a quest for the chaotic capacitor bank (infinite RF power). It would be a requirement for the Ridiculously Large Capacitor ('You'll Probably Need Quite a Few of These').\r\n\r\n- The Stargate Radiation Containment Plate ('Building Block of the Stargate') should be another requirement for the Ridiculously Large Capacitor\r\n\r\n- Eternal Singularity should be a requirement for the infinity chest.\r\n\r\n- The Ridiculously Large Capacitor should be a requirement for the Stargate Command\r\n\r\n- ~~Stargate Command should be a requirement for the Teleporter ('Anywhere, Anytime').*maybe check first that the recipe is fixed*~~ Remove Teleporter ('Anywhere, Anytime'). the recipe is broken&hopefully there will be larger teleportation rebalance soon.\r\n\r\n- Add Xenoxene/radox quest. #5049 Needs an explanation once I actually do it as the culture recipe doesn't show in NEI. And then radox, and radox polymer. Probably the same quest, maybe not. (by Prometheus0000)\r\n\r\n- Add Longbow of the Heavens (by Prometheus0000)\r\n\r\n\r\nPossible New Quests for other Tabs that are creative-like or have a dire crafting table recipe:\r\n- many DE items (tools, armor, weapons, charms, pedestal, portal, dislocator,...)\r\n- steve carts: Upgrade: Integrated Infinity Reactor\r\n- steve carts: Infinity Engine\r\n- Six different creative OC parts\r\n- Creative mode IC chip (would need an IC workbench quest with some explanations first, maybe postpone this one)\r\n- Skullfire sword (also see #5732), recipe is HV\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HellFirePvP/AstralSorcery/issues/1247","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HellFirePvP/AstralSorcery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HellFirePvP/AstralSorcery/issues/1247/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HellFirePvP/AstralSorcery/issues/1247/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HellFirePvP/AstralSorcery/issues/1247/events","html_url":"https://github.com/HellFirePvP/AstralSorcery/issues/1247","id":576795759,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NzY3OTU3NTk=","number":1247,"title":"[MC

upgrading to 0.5.0, my application logging has been nulled, by the inclusion of \"org.slf4j/slf4j-nop\" in the sieppari module.

In order for the logging to reappear again, I have to explicitly exclude the module from my dependencies, i.e.,\r\n\r\n`metosin/reitit {:mvn/version \"0.5.0\" :exclusions
