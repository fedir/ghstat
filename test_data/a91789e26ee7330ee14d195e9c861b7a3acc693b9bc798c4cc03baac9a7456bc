version: `use-subscription@1.5.0`\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run `npm install react@16.14.0 use-subscription@1.4.1`. \r\n2. Run `npm install use-subscription@1.5.0`. Note the React peer dependency error.\r\n\r\nNotably, this currently affects `npm install react@16 next@10` (see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/18518). `npm@7` will refuse to perform this installation entirely.\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\n`use-subscription@1.4.1` peer-depends on `react@^16.8.0` whereas `use-subscription@1.5.0` peer-depends on `react@^17.0.0`, which is generally considered a breaking change in a minor version. This might have been an oversight in how https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20062 interacted with https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/19373?\r\n\r\n(It's considered a breaking change because a package.json like the below should always result in a valid install.) \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"react\": \"^16.14.0\",\r\n    \"use-subscription\": \"^1.4.1\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nHere are two potential solutions:\r\n\r\n- Cut a release of `use-subscription@1.5.1` that peer-depends on `^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0`, strictly widening the peer dep range from that of 1.4.1.\r\n- Cut a major release of `use-subscription@2` that peer-depends on `^17.0.0`, and cut a release of `use-subscription@1.5.1` that reverts its peer dependency to `^16.8.0`.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/5301","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/parcel-bundler/parcel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/5301/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/5301/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/5301/events","html_url":"https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/5301","id":733213130,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzMyMTMxMzA=","number":5301,"title":"React
