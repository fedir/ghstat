When a simple token value is non-existent in prior versions this evaluated to NULL however starting from Contao 4.10 this will throw an exception. The root cause seems to be the switch to using Symfony Expression Language for simple token evaluation.\r\nThe problem for me popped up because I'm using a template in notification center for different forms. Because some input fields are only available in certain forms I used the following statements for dealing with the problem:\r\n```\r\n{if form_foo!=NULL}\r\nBar: ##form_foo##\r\n{endif}\r\n```\r\nHowever this does not work anymore with Contao 4.10.\r\n\r\nFor Symfony Expression Language the issue is known for a long time and was reported in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/21691. However it seems that resolution is not planned in a sensible timeframe. Community user webstar came up with the idea of resolving the incompatibility within Contao (see https://community.contao.org/de/newreply.php?do=newreply&p=531754).\r\n\r\nAny changes resolving the problem will be greatly appreciated.
