Problem\r\n\r\nLoad balancing is currently done by explicitly creating a `LoadBalancingClient` and then using the `CodecClientFactory` (e.g. `Redis.client.apply(sender: Sender[P, M]`) to \"lift\" the client in to the appropriate client type (e.g. `RedisClient`).\r\n\r\n```\r\nval generator = (address: InetSocketAddress) => {\r\n  Redis.client(address.getHostName, address.getPort)\r\n}\r\n\r\nval addresses                 = List.fill(3)(new InetSocketAddress(\"localhost\", 6379))\r\nval loadBalancingRedisClients = new LoadBalancingClient[Redis](worker, generator, 3, addresses)\r\nval redisClient               = Redis.client(loadBalancingRedisClients)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it would be more user friendly if the client handled load balancing itself with a configurable retry policy. It should work for callbacks and futures.\r\n\r\n```\r\nRedis.client(addresses, RetryPolicy.RoundRobin(max = addresses.lenth, expoentialBackoff = true))\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Notes from previous conversations\r\n- Add retry into on the serviceclient (separate for now, tbd later)\r\nYes, I think the way to do this is add a new config setting like \"maxRetries\" to ClientConfig, and then create a \"RetryFilter\" that extends Sender and wraps the client that is currently created.\r\n- Add loadBalancingClient to LiftedClient (or similar location)\r\nSo I think what we want to do here is create a ClientFactory for LoadBalancingClient.  This factory would require a regular client factory as a constructor param or something like that.  Then you can do something like Http.loadBalancingClient\r\n- Concept of filters to be applied to the send command (decorator)\r\nSo I think here we need to determine if this needs to be anything more than just a class that extends Sender and takes another sender as a constructor parameter.  Right now I don't think so, which means we already have everything we need to add filters.  Maybe there's some kind of DSL we would build around this, but it's not apparent that we need this.\r\n- Have the LBC expose a hostManager for client manipulation\r\nSo the idea here is the LBC doesn't expose a HostManager, but rather it requires one as a constructor parameter.  So you as the user would first create your own HostManager, pass it in when creating the LBC, and the result from that would just be a HttpClient (or whatever protocol you're using).  So you don't interact with LBC directly to change the hosts, but instead through the HostManager that you created.  If this isn't clear I'll write up some code examples.\r\n- Possibly have an error if only one client is passed to the LBC?\r\nInteresting, I can see pro's and cons to this.  Actually....now that I think about it we probably don't want to do that.  For example maybe you have a situation where on startup you only have one host to connect to, but later on (like from config polling), you add more.  We don't want to forbid something like that.\r\n- Maybe have a convenience function called maxPossibleRetries that'll take the host size and the retry size and give you the min (for troubleshooting in config environments), this could be overkill.\r\nDefinitely something that can go on HostManager, but like I said we won't be able to add any methods to LBC itself since it'll just be a Sender\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tumblr/colossus/issues/485","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tumblr/colossus","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tumblr/colossus/issues/485/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tumblr/colossus/issues/485/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tumblr/colossus/issues/485/events","html_url":"https://github.com/tumblr/colossus/issues/485","id":200065736,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDAwNjU3MzY=","number":485,"title":"Rate.hit race condition ","user":{"login":"dre-hh","id":917602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNzYwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/917602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dre-hh","html_url":"https://github.com/dre-hh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dre-hh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dre-hh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dre-hh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dre-hh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dre-hh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dre-hh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dre-hh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dre-hh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dre-hh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-01-11T11:13:20Z","updated_at":"2017-01-13T09:42:49Z","closed_at":"2017-01-12T23:30:18Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"The following code crates 2 futures, each hitting the same rate 3 times.
