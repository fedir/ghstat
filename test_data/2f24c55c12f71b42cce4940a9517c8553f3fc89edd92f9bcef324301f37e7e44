whole point of a module community is to be able to make modules from other modules, reducing the time it takes you to create your module, and increasing the robustness of all modules by reducing duplication in the community as a whole. This seems like its exactly what microjs.com is advocating - small libraries you can cobble together to create a lean system.\n\nThe problem is, disallowing people from using _any_ dependencies means that the majority of microjs's modules will be reinventing some wheel they could otherwise be pulling in another module for. Even if you just use one single dependency, a library is disallowed from being a part of the registry here. \n\nI propose that this requirement be removed.
