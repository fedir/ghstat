I'd like to only present the backtrace from the application onward (including any gems being used by the application).\r\n\r\nHere's some code I was hacking on that gets us close (goes in `Controller#process`):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodified_backtrace = error.backtrace_locations.select { |l|\r\n  l.absolute_path.include?(File.expand_path(Pakyow::App.config.app.root))\r\n}\r\n      \r\nif modified_backtrace.empty?\r\n  # pakyow broke\r\nelse\r\n  relative_path = File.expand_path(Pakyow::App.config.app.root)\r\n  error.set_backtrace modified_backtrace.map { |l|\r\n    path = Pathname.new(l.absolute_path).relative_path_from(Pathname.new(relative_path))\r\n    \"#{path.to_s}:#{l.lineno}:#{l.label}\"\r\n  }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how if we never make it out of the framework code we present the full backtrace.

Right now any lines from a gem would be excluded.\r\n\r\n## Route Names\r\n\r\nAs part of this I would also like to present actual route names. Right now it looks like:\r\n\r\n```text\r\napp/lib/routes.rb:28:in `block in <class:FooRouter>'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I would like to see this:\r\n\r\n```text\r\napp/lib/routes.rb:28:in `GET / in <class:FooRouter>'\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo do this, we would need to get the details from the matched route and create our own label.

[discussed](http://forums.pakyow.org/t/v1-0-code-loading-organization/116), we're moving away from blindly loading everything in `app/lib`. Instead, app logic will be loaded in a more predictable and organized way. We hope that fewer organizational decisions will make development more approachable to new developers and bring consistency across apps.\r\n\r\nApp logic (e.g. mappers, models, presenters, resources, routers, and views) will all be loaded in a similar way. On boot, we'll navigate through each destination, loading each file and performing validation. The app won't boot unless validation succeeds.\r\n\r\nHow validation occurs depends on what is loaded. We want to be reasonably sure that anything we load defines valid state for the app. This will happen via a new concept called loaders. A loader will be defined for each type that specifies 1) where to find the files and 2) validation rules.\r\n\r\nHere's what a loader for resources might look like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule Pakyow\r\n  class App\r\n    load :resources, with: Loaders::Resource\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  module Loaders\r\n    class Resource < Base\r\n      location :resources\r\n      \r\n      def initialize(filename, resource)\r\n        @filename = filename\r\n        @resource = resource\r\n        \r\n        # warn if @resource.name does not match @filename\r\n        #\r\n        # we could error here, but a warning seems to make more sense\r\n        # given that everything will work fine (we don't infer meaning\r\n        # from the filename) but we would prefer that the naming\r\n        # convention used makes good sense\r\n      end\r\n\r\n      def valid?\r\n        # valdate that:\r\n        # @resource is a Router subclass\r\n        # @resource expanded the resource template\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [ ] Introduce the loader concept to `Pakyow::App`\r\n- [ ] Define loaders for current features (routers and resources)","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pakyow/pakyow/issues/219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pakyow/pakyow","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pakyow/pakyow/issues/219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pakyow/pakyow/issues/219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pakyow/pakyow/issues/219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pakyow/pakyow/issues/219","id":206941949,"number":219,"title":"Reload the app when something changes","user":{"login":"bryanp","id":18920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/18920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp","html_url":"https://github.com/bryanp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":537019685,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pakyow/pakyow/labels/cli","name":"cli","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":140840,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pakyow/pakyow/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"5319e7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bryanp","id":18920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/18920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp","html_url":"https://github.com/bryanp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bryanp","id":18920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/18920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanp","html_url":"https://github.com/bryanp","followers_url":"h
