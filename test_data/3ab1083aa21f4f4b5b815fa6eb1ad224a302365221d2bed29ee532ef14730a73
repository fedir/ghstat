Describe your issue:\r\n\r\nI have a tag which loads a data via AJAX. I get an error because child tags mount before data is loaded:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<posts>\r\n    <div data-is=\"pagination\"></div>\r\n\r\n    <!-- ... -->\r\n\r\n    <div data-is=\"pagination\"></div>\r\n    <script>\r\n        const tag = this\r\n\r\n        tag.posts = undefined\r\n\r\n        tag.on('mount', function () {\r\n            const xhr = $.ajax({\r\n                method: 'POST',\r\n                url: '/get-data',\r\n                data: {\r\n                    page: 1,\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            xhr.done(function (data) {\r\n                tag.posts = data\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    </script>\r\n</posts>\r\n\r\n<pagination>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li each=\"{ page in parent.posts.pages }\">\r\n            <a href=\"{ page.url }\">{ page.number }</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</pagination>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can do something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<posts>\r\n    <div class=\"pagination\"></div>\r\n\r\n    <!-- ... -->\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"pagination\"></div>\r\n    <script>\r\n        const tag = this\r\n\r\n        tag.posts = undefined\r\n\r\n        tag.on('mount', function () {\r\n            const xhr = $.ajax({\r\n                method: 'POST',\r\n                url: '/get-data',\r\n                data: {\r\n                    page: 1,\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            xhr.done(function (data) {\r\n                tag.posts = data\r\n\r\n                riot.mount('ul.pagination', 'pagination')\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    </script>\r\n</posts>\r\n\r\n<pagination>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li each=\"{ page in parent.posts.pages }\">\r\n            <a href=\"{ page.url }\">{ page.number }</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</pagination>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut then I lose the reference to the parent tag. How can I solve this problem? I suggest to add an attribute which specify that a child tag should be mounted manualy:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<posts>\r\n    <div data-is=\"pagination\" deferred></div>\r\n\r\n    <!-- ... -->\r\n\r\n    <div data-is=\"pagination\" deferred></div>\r\n    <script>\r\n        const tag = this\r\n\r\n        tag.posts = undefined\r\n\r\n        tag.on('mount', function () {\r\n            const xhr = $.ajax({\r\n                method: 'POST',\r\n                url: '/get-data',\r\n                data: {\r\n                    page: 1,\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            xhr.done(function (data) {\r\n                tag.posts = data\r\n\r\n                riot.mount('div[data-is=\"pagination\"]')\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    </script>\r\n</posts>\r\n\r\n<pagination>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li each=\"{ page in parent.posts.pages }\">\r\n            <a href=\"{ page.url }\">{ page.number }</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</pagination>\r\n```\r\n\r\n5.
