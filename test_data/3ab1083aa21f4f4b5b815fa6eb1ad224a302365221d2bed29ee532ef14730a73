Describe your issue:\r\nThis is a weird one and may be related to electronjs rather than riotjs, but the error points to riot.\r\n\r\nIf I use any kind of quotes (single or double) inside curly brackets in a tag, the app breaks in electronjs.\r\n\r\nFor example: this code in a tag `<div if={visible == 'yes'}>Success!</div>` breaks\r\n\r\nThe error is `Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`. The tag is compiled and starts rendering fine, but as soon as `{visible == 'yes'}` is evaluated it borks and the debugger tries to give some help by showing this code\r\n```\r\n(function(E\r\n/*``*/) {\r\nreturn (\"visible\"in this?this:window).visible == â—0~;\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThe stacktrace just points to riots, and starts with the `this.update()` method.\r\nAt first it seems to be a unicode issue, but if I look at the compiled tag, there is no issue: `it\\'s broken. <div if=\"{visible == \\'yes\\'}\">`\r\n\r\nI'll post in electron as well\r\n\r\n2.

Help us to manage our issues by answering the following:\r\n\r\n1. Describe your issue:\r\nI am attempting to make an isomorphic Riot application, however, I can't get JSPM to work with a server-side node program that includes Riot in any way, with JSPM 0.17.0-beta.42 and Riot 3.8.1 . There are a few issues that pop up, depending, but they all are focused on a lack of dependencies being marked.\r\n\r\nWhen one attempts to run a program which imports riot (lib/server/index.js), it errors by indicating that the dependency between lib/server/index.js and riot is not marked.\r\n2. Can you reproduce the issue?\r\nAbsolutely. With file 'tag.js':\r\n```\r\nimport riot from 'riot';\r\n\r\nconst Renderable = riot.tag('renderable', '<html></html>', function(...args) {\r\n   return true;\r\n});\r\n```\r\nand file test.js:\r\n```import dr from 'tag.js'```\r\nExecuting ```jspm run test.js``` yields an output of:\r\n```\r\nError: Module /PATH/jspm_packages/npm/riot@3.8.1/riot not declared as a System.registerDynamic dependency of file:///PAPTH/jspm_packages/npm/riot@3.8.1/lib/server/index.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe .json file that is generated for jspm (jspm_packages/npm/riot@3.8.1.json) is:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"main\": \"lib/server/index.js\",\r\n  \"format\": \"cjs\",\r\n  \"meta\": {\r\n    \"*\": {\r\n      \"globals\": {\r\n        \"process\": \"process\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"*.json\": {\r\n      \"format\": \"json\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"lib/browser/*\": {\r\n      \"format\": \"esm\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"lib/riot+compiler.js\": {\r\n      \"format\": \"esm\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"lib/riot.js\": {\r\n      \"format\": \"esm\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"lib/settings.js\": {\r\n      \"format\": \"esm\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"riot.min.js\": {\r\n      \"format\": \"amd\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"map\": {\r\n    \"./lib/server\": \"./lib/server/index.js\",\r\n    \"./lib/server/index.js\": {\r\n      \"browser\": \"./riot.js\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Additional note: once the dependency is fixed, there appear to be issues with finding riot-tmpl as well in other files, but this is kinda the start.)\r\n\r\n3. On which browser/OS does the issue appear?\r\nnode , MacOS\r\n4. Which version of Riot does it affect?\r\n3.8.1, server-side\r\n\r\n5.
