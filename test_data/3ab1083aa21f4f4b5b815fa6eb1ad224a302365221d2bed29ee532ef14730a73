Describe your issue:**\r\n\r\nCreating a new site and I'm trying to understand how mounting is working with riotjs router. Here's my current configuration for the router:\r\n\r\n     route.base('/')\r\n        route('/', function () {\r\n            riot.mount('view', 'home')\r\n        })\r\n        route('/profile/*/*', function (id) {\r\n            riot.mount('view', 'profile', {\r\n                \"id\": id\r\n           })\r\n        })\r\n\r\nThe home tag has includes several other tags that are mounted within that make calls my database via ajax.\r\n\r\nThe issue I'm having is when I navigate between profile and home, I'm seeing ajax calls happen twice from .tags within the home.tag. I'm assuming these are virtual as they show\r\n\r\n    VM9671 ride-of-the-day.html.js:2 ROTD\r\nIn Chrome tools, the other call looks like\r\n\r\n    /views/home/ride-of-the-day.html.js:2 ROTD\r\nMy assumption is that each time the route changes it's remounting the views below, I'm currently utilizing a single <view></view> tag in my markup.\r\n\r\nI've tried keeping track of the currently mounted tag and unmounting within each route but that didn't seem to resolve this.\r\n\r\nAm I following a bad pattern, is there a better way of doing this?\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Can you reproduce the issue?**\r\n\r\nA example of the code is posted here: http://tpcweb.us-3.evennode.com/  \r\n\r\nThis is the home tag that is mounted via the index : view-source:http://tpcweb.us-3.evennode.com/views/home/home.html\r\n\r\nIf you click on the \"El Toro\" under Top Rides and the click \"Home\" under the console you will see the ajax request within this tag http://tpcweb.us-3.evennode.com/views/home/ride-of-the-day.html is executing twice.\r\n\r\nAs a note all of the tags on the home.html tag are executing twice, I just have the ride of the day tag logging out.\r\n\r\n**3. On which browser/OS does the issue appear?**\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n**4. Which version of Riot does it affect?**\r\nLatest\r\n\r\n**5.

Describe your issue:\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue while developing a tag where I wanted to pass in a function in its `opts`.\r\n\r\n    <parent-tag>\r\n      <search-tag search={ my_search_fn }></search-tag>\r\n\r\n      this.my_search_fn = function(query) { return $.get(/*...*/, {q: query}) }\r\n    </parent-tag>\r\n\r\nThe function itself is not an event handler -- it accepts a string -- but is intended to be included in one within the tag.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the function seems to be added to the `<search-tag>` as an event handler for the \"search\" event.  I would not have expected this unless I used the \"onsearch\" attribute.  I suspect that Riot adds any attribute with a function value as an event handler regardless of the attribute name.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that this is a bug but should Riot only attach event handlers for valid event attributes, i.e., only for attribute names matching \"on*\"?  If I did this outside of Riot, `<div click=\"alert('Hello')\">`, the browser would not fire the alert because the correct attribute is `onclick`, not `click`.\r\n\r\n2. Can you reproduce the issue?\r\n\r\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/LmeTBmm4m6EAHkmiRZao\r\n\r\nI used the \"click\" event instead of the \"search\" event in Plunker.  You'll need to open the console, and you'll see both the string and the event logged each time the button is clicked.\r\n\r\n3. On which browser/OS does the issue appear?\r\n\r\nI observed this in Chromium and Opera on macOS.\r\n\r\n4. Which version of Riot does it affect?\r\n\r\nI'm using Riot 3.6.3, but the Plunker above is the latest (3.10.0).\r\n\r\n5.
