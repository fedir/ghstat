Content-Type header instead of adding new one when returning json\n\nThis change prevents the web server from returning 2 \"Content-Type\" headers instead of one\nif a \"Content-Type\" header was already added as one of the default headers (in\nturbo.web.RequestHandler:set_default_headers). Now there will be one Content-Type header at\nmost.\n\nThe reason is that it is useful to set as default header \"Content-type: text/plain\" when\nyou want to return that content (and not the default text/html) for 4xx and 5xx return codes\nwhile returning json for 200. Without the present commit, in the happy path (200 return code),\nthe web server returned 2 Content-type headers (text/plain and application/json).","tree":{"sha":"3a26f729de30f8aa3c250432d05b88db4e1afec6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/git/trees/3a26f729de30f8aa3c250432d05b88db4e1afec6"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/git/commits/3e3d905b3d8cc3c34d1ea225de49b26abbecbf4b","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/commits/3e3d905b3d8cc3c34d1ea225de49b26abbecbf4b","html_url":"https://github.com/kernelsauce/turbo/commit/3e3d905b3d8cc3c34d1ea225de49b26abbecbf4b","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/commits/3e3d905b3d8cc3c34d1ea225de49b26abbecbf4b/comments","author":{"login":"ccarrascoEEN","id":49515665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTE1NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/49515665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN","html_url":"https://github.com/ccarrascoEEN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"ccarrascoEEN","id":49515665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTE1NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/49515665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN","html_url":"https://github.com/ccarrascoEEN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccarrascoEEN/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"61ee3a3b9c79631d4368728cf0396b5d02eacf86","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/commits/61ee3a3b9c79631d4368728cf0396b5d02eacf86","html_url":"https://github.com/kernelsauce/turbo/commit/61ee3a3b9c79631d4368728cf0396b5d02eacf86"}]},{"sha":"61ee3a3b9c79631d4368728cf0396b5d02eacf86","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MzIzOTg5OTo2MWVlM2EzYjljNzk2MzFkNDM2ODcyOGNmMDM5NmI1ZDAyZWFjZjg2","commit":{"author":{"name":"John
