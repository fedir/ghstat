https://github.com/YorickPeterse/oga/blob/5d0e8c99af86dab9f4d1840f37625bf6b964c379/lib/oga/xml/lexer.rb#L208. Here `@elements.empty?` is apparently `nil.empty?`. Unless I'm blind this is _impossible_ because `@elements` is ever only assigned an empty Array (https://github.com/YorickPeterse/oga/blob/5d0e8c99af86dab9f4d1840f37625bf6b964c379/lib/oga/xml/lexer.rb#L132) and instances of this class are not shared between threads (the lexer is deliberately set up to promote against this by passing the input in `#initialize` rather than a separate method). The only theory I can think of is that somehow the GC sets the `@elements` variable to nil.\n\nLog output: https://gist.github.com/YorickPeterse/b72b65c4e650d7d807bf\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sdogruyol/friends-of-crystal/issues/6","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sdogruyol/friends-of-crystal","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sdogruyol/friends-of-crystal/issues/6/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sdogruyol/friends-of-crystal/issues/6/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sdogruyol/friends-of-crystal/issues/6/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sdogruyol/friends-of-crystal/issues/6","id":511691401,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MTE2OTE0MDE=","number":6,"title":"New Website Logo: ACAEngine","user":{"login":"KimBurgess","id":843652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzY1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/843652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBurgess","html_url":"https://github.com/KimBurgess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBurgess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBurgess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBurgess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBurgess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBurgess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBurgess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBurgess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBurgess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBurgess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-10-24T03:56:38Z","updated_at":"2019-11-21T15:14:21Z","closed_at":"2019-11-21T15:14:21Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"To list your organization's logo on Friends of Crystal website, fill out the following information and click \"submit new issue\".\r\n\r\n- Organization name: ACAEngine\r\n- Homepage url: [https://acaengine.com/](https://acaprojects.com/)\r\n- Logo url (400x400):\r\n![ACAEngine Logo](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13131204?s=400&u=2ad37c30d8d7d8b2f9c7482cab55bfd31b8b51a6&v=4)\r\n- How you are using Crystal: APIs for physical environments (full stack: https://github.com/aca-labs/)\r\n- Url describing Crystal usage: https://acaprojects.com/the-aca-blog/2019/3/18/introducing-spider-gazelle-our-open-source-web-framework\r\n- Organization contact: kim@acaprojects.com","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/veelenga/awesome-crystal/issues/412","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/veelenga/awesome-crystal","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/veelenga/awesome-crystal/issues/412/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/veelenga/awesome-crystal/issues/412/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/veelenga/awesome-crystal/issues/412/events","html_url":"https://github.com/veelenga/awesome-crystal/issues/412","id":446295594,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDYyOTU1OTQ=","number":412,"title":"Include CI badges for each shard","user":{"login":"Blacksmoke16","id":12136995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTM2OTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12136995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blacksmoke16","html_url":"https://github.com/Blacksmoke16","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blacksmoke16/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blacksmoke16/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blacksmoke16/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blacksmoke16/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blacksmoke16/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blacksmoke16/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blacksmoke16/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blacksmoke16/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blacksmoke16/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":22,"created_at":"2019-05-20T20:27:50Z","updated_at":"2019-11-02T21:13:28Z","closed_at":"2019-11-02T21:01:38Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"This would allow users at a glance to see the statues of shards.
