Version? no\r\n- Does it work on the newest sources in GitHub? (Build by source -> https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/wiki/Building-From-Source) no\r\n\r\n## 2) Expected behavior\r\nUsing custom `@NotNull`, `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` constraints results in the same behaviour of the OutputLabelRenderer (with regards to the required-marker).\r\n\r\n## 3) Actual behavior\r\nUsing a custom `@NotNull` constraint does not show a required marker, but using custom `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` do (disregarding any composite constraints, #3708 aims at fixing that use case). The reason for this is the check in the `OutputLabelRenderer#isBeanValidationDefined`. For `@NotNull` the check happens on a class level (`annotationType.equals(NotNull.class)`), that means that the class must be exactly the same (package etc.). For `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` only the simple name is used `(annotationType.getSimpleName()`), that means the constraint can come from any package and just needs the name `@NotEmpty` or `@NotBlank`.\r\nThis creates an inconsistency in the way the constraints are handled. It should be one or the other, so the behaviour becomes more predictable.\r\n\r\nIf someone from the PR team agrees with this, I could easily create a PR to change the behaviour, but I am not sure which version is better: checking the exact class or just the simple name.\r\nPersonally I prefer using the class, as it makes it more predictable and works only with the originally intended constraints (for custom use cases they could be wrapped by composite constraints #3708).\r\n\r\nThis could potentially be a \"breaking\" change for a few people (the required marker would be missing for people who named their custom constraints `@NotEmpty` or `@NotBlank`).","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3706","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3706/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3706/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3706/events","html_url":"https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3706","id":325604755,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjU2MDQ3NTU=","number":3706,"title":"InputNumber:
