IMPORTANT \r\n- !!! If you open an issue, fill every item. Otherwise the issue might be closed as invalid. !!!\r\n\r\n- Before you open an issue, test it with the current/newest version.\r\n- Try to find an explanation to your problem by yourself, by simply debugging. This will help us to solve your issue 10x faster\r\n- Clone this repository https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces-test.git in order to reproduce your problem, you'll have better chance to receive an answer and a solution.\r\n- Otherwise the example must be as small and simple as possible! It must be runnable without any other dependencies (like Spring,..., or project/company internal classes)!\r\n- Feel free to provide a PR (Primefaces is an open-source project, any fixes or improvements are welcome.)\r\n\r\n## 1) Environment\r\n- PrimeFaces version: 6.2.2\r\n- Does it work on the newest released PrimeFaces version? Version?\r\n- Does it work on the newest sources in GitHub? (Build by source -> https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/wiki/Building-From-Source)\r\n- Application server + version: WebSphere Liberty Profile 18.0.0.1\r\n- Affected browsers: Chrome, FF, MS Edge\r\n\r\n## 2) Expected behavior\r\nWe have a payment response page that contains an inline script in the <head> section of the HTML but does not contain any <body> tag as this page is only used as a passthrough.\r\n\r\nWhen using primefaces.MOVE_SCRIPTS_TO_BOTTOM, if the page does not contain a body tag, either create the body tag to move the script in, or do not move the inline script from the head section, but do not discard the script completely.\r\n\r\n## 3) Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen using primefaces.MOVE_SCRIPTS_TO_BOTTOM and no body tag is defined in the xhtml file, the inline script is completely discarded from the page.\r\n\r\n## 4) Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAdd the context param `primefaces.MOVE_SCRIPTS_TO_BOTTOM` with value `true` to web.xml\r\nCreate an xhtml file as per the sample below.\r\n\r\n## 5) Sample XHTML\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n   <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n      // Redirect to get out of the iframe\r\n      var str= self.location.href;\r\n      var res = str.replace(\"return\", \"return2\");\r\n      \r\n       top.location = res;\r\n   </script>\r\n</head>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n## 6) Sample bean\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously this is low priority as there are many workarounds. I personally added an empty body tag to my html and everything started working fine again.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be coming from `primefaces/src/main/java/org/primefaces/application/resource/MoveScriptsToBottomResponseWriter.java` where the body tag is expected.\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3553","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3553/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3553/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3553/events","html_url":"https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3553","id":311543023,"number":3553,"title":"FileUpload: does not update the 'aria-disabled' attribute for the upload and cancel buttons","user":{"login":"sarvigalava","id":1483034,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1483034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarvigalava","html_url":"https://github.com/sarvigalava","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarvigalava/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarvigalava/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarvigalava/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarvigalava/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarvigalava/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarvigalava/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarvigalava/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarvigalava/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarvigalava/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":198352643,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"0052cc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-04-05T09:49:54Z","updated_at":"2018-04-05T11:34:20Z","closed_at":"2018-04-05T11:33:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# IMPORTANT \r\n- !!!

options.put(\"modal\", true);\r\n         options.put(\"width\", 50%); <------------\r\n         options.put(\"height\", 90%); <-----------\r\n         options.put(\"contentWidth\", \"100%\");\r\n         options.put(\"contentHeight\", \"100%\");\r\n         options.put(\"headerElement\", \"customheader\");\r\n          \r\n         PrimeFaces.current().dialog.openDynamic(\"viewCars\", options, null);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n> Width is ok, but height isn't on the same level but on a div inside and the rendering isn't work correctly\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3539","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3539/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3539/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3539/events","html_url":"https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3539","id":309337684,"number":3539,"title":"The

Class `org.primefaces.util.WidgetBuilder` has a method `WidgetBuilder initWithDomReady(String, String, String)` that adds this Javascript indirection, but not if `facesContext.isPostback()`. IMHO this check should be removed.\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/2888 also seems related to this: if `MOVE_SCRIPTS_TO_BOTTOM` is activated, it would also trigger this bug.\r\n\r\n## Update\r\nThis issue is definitively related to #2888. If I add\r\n```\r\n    <context-param>\r\n        <param-name>primefaces.MOVE_SCRIPTS_TO_BOTTOM</param-name>\r\n        <param-value>true</param-value>\r\n    </context-param>\r\n```\r\nto `web.xml` (or in my case `web-fragment.xml`, the popup is filled as expected.

Download the latest version of Primefaces Community (Current 6.2)\r\n\r\n2.) Extract the primefaces-6.2.jar with an unpacker into a folder e.g. primefaces-6.2\r\n\r\n3.) Go into the folder and go to the following subfolder:\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\res
3844
ources\r\n\r\n5.) When you check the filesize of the folders inside the resources you will see where \r\nthe big size is coming from:\r\n\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\resources\\primefaces\\fa\\\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\resources\\primefaces-aristo\\\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\resources\\primefaces-omega\\\r\n\r\n**The filesize of this 3 folders is 1,4MB big !**\r\nOn a sum filesize of 4,07MB this is very much !!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The solution ?**\r\n1.) For using WebFonts it's recommed to only link to the external CDN-Server instead of\r\nincluding them complete to the application.\r\nFor e.g. Font-Awesome use the given CDN-Link when the feature is enabled because it's always \r\nfaster loaded via CDN-Server:\r\n\r\n2.) The other resources needed for the Pro/Elite-Themes only should be put into the packed Themes \r\nand then linked to them.\r\nAlso the WebFonts should be loaded from a CDN-Server instead of putting them to the Primefaces-Package. \r\nIf this does not work you can always use the CDNResource-Handler from Omnifaces to redirect\r\nresources to another URL:\r\n[http://showcase.omnifaces.org/resourcehandlers/CDNResourceHandler](http://showcase.omnifaces.org/resourcehandlers/CDNResourceHandler)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491/events","html_url":"https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491","id":305784044,"number":3491,"title":"New component: Material Floating Button ","user":{"login":"ybendek","id":13785120,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13785120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek","html_url":"https://github.com/ybendek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":198352642,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":198664493,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/labels/new%20feature","name":"new feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-03-16T02:42:37Z","updated_at":"2018-03-17T12:26:35Z","closed_at":"2018-03-17T12:26:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It could be nice to include a similar component like this component.
