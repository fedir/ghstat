1) Environment\r\n- PrimeFaces version: 6.2.1\r\n- Does it work on the newest released PrimeFaces version? Version? no\r\n- Does it work on the newest sources in GitHub? (Build by source -> https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/wiki/Building-From-Source) no\r\n- Application server + version: Tomcat 8.5.15\r\n- Affected browsers: Firefox 59, IE 11, Chrome65.0.3325.181\r\n\r\n## 2) Expected behavior\r\nThe popup panel of the ColumnToggler always shows names of columns with a checkbox for the table it references.\r\n\r\n## 3) Actual behavior\r\nAfter a full POST, the popup panel of the ColumnToggler is empty.\r\n..\r\n\r\n## 4) Steps to reproduce\r\n- Run the xhtml sample below.\r\n- Click on 'toggle columns': the names of all four columns are in the popup, together with a checkbox.\r\n- Click on 'post' and wait for the page to be loaded.\r\n- Click on 'toggle columns': the popup is empty.\r\n\r\n## 5) Sample XHTML\r\n```\r\n<html\r\n        xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\r\n        xmlns:h=\"http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html\"\r\n        xmlns:ui=\"http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/facelets\"\r\n        xmlns:f=\"http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core\"\r\n        xmlns:p=\"http://primefaces.org/ui\"\r\n>\r\n<h:head>\r\n</h:head>\r\n<h:body>\r\n    <h:form>\r\n        <p:dataTable id=\"table\">\r\n            <f:facet name=\"header\">\r\n                <p:commandButton id=\"columnToggler\" value=\"toggle columns\"/>\r\n                <p:columnToggler trigger=\"columnToggler\" datasource=\"table\"/>\r\n            </f:facet>\r\n\r\n            <p:column headerText=\"one\">\r\n            </p:column>\r\n            <p:column headerText=\"two\">\r\n            </p:column>\r\n            <p:column headerText=\"three\">\r\n            </p:column>\r\n            <p:column headerText=\"four\">\r\n            </p:column>\r\n        </p:dataTable>\r\n        <p:commandButton value=\"post\" ajax=\"false\"/>\r\n    </h:form>\r\n</h:body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 6) Sample bean\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\n## Remarks\r\nLooking at the differences in html page sources, it is obvious that the erroneous POST-screen lacks `$(function(){ /* ... */ })`. Class `org.primefaces.util.WidgetBuilder` has a method `WidgetBuilder initWithDomReady(String, String, String)` that adds this Javascript indirection, but not if `facesContext.isPostback()`. IMHO this check should be removed.\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/2888 also seems related to this: if `MOVE_SCRIPTS_TO_BOTTOM` is activated, it would also trigger this bug.\r\n\r\n## Update\r\nThis issue is definitively related to #2888. If I add\r\n```\r\n    <context-param>\r\n        <param-name>primefaces.MOVE_SCRIPTS_TO_BOTTOM</param-name>\r\n        <param-value>true</param-value>\r\n    </context-param>\r\n```\r\nto `web.xml` (or in my case `web-fragment.xml`, the popup is filled as expected. So it seems one can use `MOVE_SCRIPTS_TO_BOTTOM` as a workaround / mitigation for this issue.\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3526","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3526/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3526/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3526/events","html_url":"https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3526","id":308450045,"number":3526,"title":"OutputLink

Download the latest version of Primefaces Community (Current 6.2)\r\n\r\n2.) Extract the primefaces-6.2.jar with an unpacker into a folder e.g. primefaces-6.2\r\n\r\n3.) Go into the folder and go to the following subfolder:\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\resources\r\n\r\n5.) When you check the filesize of the folders inside the resources you will see where \r\nthe big size is coming from:\r\n\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\resources\\primefaces\\fa\\\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\resources\\primefaces-aristo\\\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\resources\\primefaces-omega\\\r\n\r\n**The filesize of this 3 folders is 1,4MB big !**\r\nOn a sum filesize of 4,07MB this is very much !!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The solution ?**\r\n1.) For using WebFonts it's recommed to only link to the external CDN-Server instead of\r\nincluding them complete to the application.\r\nFor e.g. Font-Awesome use the given CDN-Link when the feature is enabled because it's always \r\nfaster loaded via CDN-Server:\r\n\r\n2.) The other resources needed for the Pro/Elite-Themes only should be put into the packed Themes \r\nand then linked to them.\r\nAlso the WebFonts should be loaded from a CDN-Server instead of putting them to the Primefaces-Package. \r\nIf this does not work you can always use the CDNResource-Handler from Omnifaces to redirect\r\nresources to another URL:\r\n[http://showcase.omnifaces.org/resourcehandlers/CDNResourceHandler](http://showcase.omnifaces.org/resourcehandlers/CDNResourceHandler)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491/events","html_url":"https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491","id":305784044,"number":3491,"title":"New component: Material Floating Button ","user":{"login":"ybendek","id":13785120,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13785120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek","html_url":"https://github.com/ybendek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":198352642,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":198664493,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/labels/new%20feature","name":"new feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-03-16T02:42:37Z","updated_at":"2018-03-17T12:26:35Z","closed_at":"2018-03-17T12:26:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It could be nice to include a similar component like this component.
