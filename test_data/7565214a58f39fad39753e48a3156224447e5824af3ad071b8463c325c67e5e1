Script hasn't changed\r\n- Does it work on the newest sources in GitHub? (Build by source -> https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/wiki/Building-From-Source)\r\n- Application server + version: Server independent\r\n- Affected browsers: Browser independent\r\n\r\n## 2) Expected behavior\r\nIf I use a p:captcha on a page and then use an ajax-action to navigate to another page I expect no javascript error to be thrown and that any other javascript still works as expected.\r\n\r\n## 3) Actual behavior\r\nIf I use a p:captcha on

a page and then use an ajax-action to navigate to another page I get the following error in the browser console: `Error: No reCAPTCHA clients exist.`\r\nOther javascript that should be executed with

1) Environment\r\n- PrimeFaces version: 6.2.1\r\n- Does it work on the newest released PrimeFaces version?

Class `org.primefaces.util.WidgetBuilder` has a method `WidgetBuilder initWithDomReady(String, String, String)` that adds this Javascript indirection, but not if `facesContext.isPostback()`. IMHO this check should be removed.\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/2888 also seems related to this: if `MOVE_SCRIPTS_TO_BOTTOM` is activated, it would also trigger this bug.\r\n\r\n## Update\r\nThis issue is definitively related to #2888. If I add\r\n```\r\n    <context-param>\r\n        <param-name>primefaces.MOVE_SCRIPTS_TO_BOTTOM</param-name>\r\n        <param-value>true</param-value>\r\n    </context-param>\r\n```\r\nto `web.xml` (or in my case `web-fragment.xml`, the popup is filled as expected. So it seems one can use `MOVE_SCRIPTS_TO_BOTTOM` as a workaround / mitigation for this issue.\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3526","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3526/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3526/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3526/events","html_url":"https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3526","id":308450045,"number":3526,"title":"OutputLink component doesn't work correctly in the header of panel","user":{"login":"mertsincan","id":11868120,"avatar_url":"ht
