1) Environment\r\n- PrimeFaces version: 6.2.3\r\n- Does it work on the newest released PrimeFaces version? Version? no\r\n- Application server + version: Tomcat v8.0\r\n- Affected browsers: all\r\n- Mojarra version 2.2.15, 2.2.16, 2.2.17\r\n\r\n## 2) Expected behavior\r\nWhen using p:inputNumber inside c:if tag,  \"loaded to page by ajax\" the javascripts should work properly.\r\n\r\n## 3) Actual behavior\r\nBrowser's console shows JS error: **Widget not available: InputNumber** and the inputs are not formatted correctly (formatting function with thousand delimiter, currency etc. is not invoked).\r\n\r\nIf there was p:inputNumber component in the page on page-load, the JS would work. In this example there is no p:inputNumber in page on load and the component is added using ajax request. The inputnumber/inputnumber.js is \"transfered\" to the client browser but it is somehow broken.\r\n\r\nIn Mojarra versin 2.3.2 it works well, but I can't upgrade.\r\n\r\n## 4) Steps to reproduce\r\nAlter PF showcase using XHTML and Java code below.
