Download the latest version of Primefaces Community (Current 6.2)\r\n\r\n2.) Extract the primefaces-6.2.jar with an unpacker into a folder e.g. primefaces-6.2\r\n\r\n3.) Go into the folder and go to the following subfolder:\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\resources\r\n\r\n5.) When you check the filesize of the folders inside the resources you will see where \r\nthe big size is coming from:\r\n\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\resources\\primefaces\\fa\\\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\resources\\primefaces-aristo\\\r\n\\primefaces-6.2\\META-INF\\resources\\primefaces-omega\\\r\n\r\n**The filesize of this 3 folders is 1,4MB big !**\r\nOn a sum filesize of 4,07MB this is very much !!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The solution ?**\r\n1.) For using WebFonts it's recommed to only link to the external CDN-Server instead of\r\nincluding them complete to the application.\r\nFor e.g. Font-Awesome use the given CDN-Link when the feature is enabled because it's always \r\nfaster loaded via CDN-Server:\r\n\r\n2.) The other resources needed for the Pro/Elite-Themes only should be put into the packed Themes \r\nand then linked to them.\r\nAlso the WebFonts should be loaded from a CDN-Server instead of putting them to the Primefaces-Package. \r\nIf this does not work you can always use the CDNResource-Handler from Omnifaces to redirect\r\nresources to another URL:\r\n[http://showcase.omnifaces.org/resourcehandlers/CDNResourceHandler](http://showcase.omnifaces.org/resourcehandlers/CDNResourceHandler)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491/events","html_url":"https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3491","id":305784044,"number":3491,"title":"New component: Material Floating Button ","user":{"login":"ybendek","id":13785120,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13785120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek","html_url":"https://github.com/ybendek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybendek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":198352642,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":198664493,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/labels/new%20feature","name":"new feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-03-16T02:42:37Z","updated_at":"2018-03-17T12:26:35Z","closed_at":"2018-03-17T12:26:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It could be nice to include a similar component like this component.

It should convert all values to their respective index in the list of select items. So HTML should look something like this\r\n```\r\n<select>\r\n    <option value=\"0\">Ascending</option>\r\n    <option value=\"1\">Descending</option>\r\n</select>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3) Actual behavior\r\nIf the value of an SelectItem is of type String the converter is not called.\r\nThis leads to problems when the converter's _getAsObject()_ metod is called, without a previous call of _getAsString()_.\r\nBack to the example using the _SelectItemsIndexConverter_ provided by Omnifaces the actual HTLM output looks like this:\r\n```\r\n<select>\r\n    <option value=\"A\">Ascending</option>\r\n    <option value=\"D\">Descending</option>\r\n</select>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4) Steps to reproduce\r\n```\r\n<p:selectOneMenu value=\"#{view.sorting}\" converter=\"omnifaces.SelectItemsIndexConverter\">\r\n    <f:selectItem itemValue=\"A\" itemLabel=\"Ascending\" />\r\n    <f:selectItem itemValue=\"D\" itemLabel=\"Descending\" />\r\n</p:selectOneMenu>\r\n```\r\n---\r\nThis behaviour was introduced with [`a638565`](https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/commit/a638565051f37f0b626fe3efa447b11db9a39378#diff-e4d3a342df3de892c8fd79acabe27e6bL506)\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3461","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3461/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3461/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3461/events","html_url":"https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3461","id":303751171,"number":3461,"title":"Primefaces Terminal , Cant process CR + LF , even embedding <BR> doesnt help","user":{"login":"stuartruss","id":8437184,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8437184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stuartruss","html_url":"https://github.com/stuartruss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stuartruss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stuartruss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stuartruss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stuartruss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stuartruss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stuartruss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stuartruss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stuartruss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stuartruss/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":198352645,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/primefaces/primefaces/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-03-09T07:39:14Z","updated_at":"2018-03-09T08:56:53Z","closed_at":"2018-03-09T08:56:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# IMPORTANT \r\n- !!!
