While this shouldn't be a real problem, the `$dsl->app->add_hook` is called all the times, resulting in 3 code blocks. This specific plugin deletes data in this hook, so by the last time it hits, there's no data left.

bug was introduced in #3735. Here's an expanded version of my comment from there.\r\n\r\nThis change recognizes files with no extension and a perl shebang and POD contents as POD files, but I'd expect them to be shown as syntax-highlighted perl. I would expect POD-only files to (maybe) have a `.pod` extension, and (always) no shebang. Some examples from CPAN:\r\n\r\nhttps://metacpan.org/source/LEONT/Module-Build-0.4224/lib/Module/Build/API.pod has no shebang and a `.pod` extension.\r\n\r\nhttps://metacpan.org/source/LEONT/Module-Build-0.4224/lib/Module/Build/Cookbook.pm has no shebang and a `.pm` extension.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of where linguist chooses to render as POD rather than as syntax-highlighted perl: https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/5c2fe87019dadbecb1883bedd075cd07b07b2078/src/gitolite\r\nIt previously displayed as a highlighted perl script (good), but now displays as the embedded POD (requiring me to use the Raw view to be able to see the code). It has a shebang.\r\n\r\nPlease fix it to correctly detect these kinds of files as perl (not POD) or revert it, thanks!","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer2/issues/1305","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer2/issues/1305/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer2/issues/1305/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer2/issues/1305/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer2/issues/1305","id":201825485,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDE4MjU0ODU=","number":1305,"title":"JSON post data getting lost","user":{"login":"jahagirdar","id":1273287,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMyODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1273287?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahagirdar","html_url":"https://github.com/jahagirdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahagirdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahagirdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahagirdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahagirdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahagirdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahagirdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahagirdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahagirdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahagirdar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":37603801,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzYwMzgwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer2/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-01-19T10:52:35Z","updated_at":"2017-07-16T22:33:16Z","closed_at":"2017-07-16T22:33:16Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"My test code is\r\n```\r\nuse strict;\r\nuse warnings;\r\nuse Test::More tests=>3;\r\nuse Plack::Test;\r\nuse HTTP::Request::Common;\r\nuse Test::JSON::More;\r\nuse JSON;\r\n\r\n{\r\n    package App;\r\n\r\n    use Dancer2;\r\n    use Dancer2::Plugin::REST;\r\n    use Data::Dumper;\r\n    prepare_serializer_for_format;\r\n\r\n    post '/namecheck.:format' => sub {\r\n\tmy $data=body_parameters->get('item');\r\n\tdebug Dumper($data);\r\n # There is already a bug on using body_parameters with JSON so lets try params\r\n        my $post_params = params('body');\r\n\tdebug Dumper($post_params);\r\n\treturn \"Foo\";\r\n\r\n\r\n    };\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nmy $app = App->to_app;\r\nis( ref $app, 'CODE', 'Got app' );\r\nmy $test = Plack::Test->create($app);\r\nmy $json='{\"item\":{\"type\":\"test\"}}';\r\nok_json($json, \"JSON Seems wellformed\");\r\nmy $req = HTTP::Request->new(POST => \"/namecheck.json\");\r\n$req->header(\"Content-Type\"=>\"application/json\");\r\n$req->content($json);\r\nmy $res=$test->request($req);\r\nis( $res->code, 200, '[POST: Check Name  ] ' )or BAIL_OUT(\"checking of a name  is necessary for testing to proceed.\");\r\ndiag $res->content;\r\n############################################\r\n\tdone_testing;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth the debug statements are empty indicating that the passed parameters are not reaching the route.\r\n```\r\n prove -v t/t2.pl\r\n\r\n\r\n[App:26439] debug @2017-01-19 16:17:36> $VAR1 = undef;
