c35ace622492da4ca53c055c9af0fa0346aa178b.\n\nPR 11945 / this commit introduces a silent change of behavior,\nwhich leads to fields with postblit not having their postblit\ncalled anymore.\nA deprecation path was proposed, and would require the user to\ndisable postblit when a copy constructor is present,\nor issue a deprecation message otherwise.\nOther options are likely available to avoid a silent behavior change.\nHowever, since the PR was merged within 4 minutes of being submitted,\nthere were no time for such suggestions.\nAdditionally, the PR was lacking both a spec PR and a changelog
