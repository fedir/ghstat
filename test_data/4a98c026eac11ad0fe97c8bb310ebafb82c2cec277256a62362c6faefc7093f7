For the moment, the old db is not a factor, I started completely new to see if I can get the login page to load correctly, and then I'll worry about my data (that will be whole other problem, I suspect).

Via `git clone` or by downloading the package? **git clone**\r\n* Last wallabag version that did not exhibit the issue (if applicable): n/a\r\n* php version: **.7.3**\r\n* OS: Ubuntu **20.04.1**\r\n* type of hosting (shared or dedicated): **dedicated**\r\n* which storage system you choose at install (SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL): **MariaDB**\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce/test case\r\n\r\nFollowed git install instructions. \r\nEntered info for parameters.yml when prompted. \r\nConfirmed wallabag folder has correct ownership: `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data wallabag`\r\nTried loading https://my-domain, it redirects to /login, there is a login box but images, js, and stylesheets don't load (404 error in browser console for .js and .css) \r\nExecuted `make update` inside wallabag dir, it produced the output above regarding copying assets. No errors in output (aside from a PHP warning about `\"continue\" targeting switch is equivalent to \"break\"`, when clearing cache).\r\n\r\nIn `parameters.yml' I have set `domain_name: 'https://mydomain.org'`\r\nIn nginx config I have `root /var/www/wallabag/web;` which is the correct location\r\nnginx config is the same from previous install on now dead server, should be valid. \r\n\r\nRead through previous issues about this, did not see anything helpful or relevant. I can provide `make install` output, but there are no errors in there.

the automagic creation of routes based on the class and method names is the worst part of the rest bundle.\r\n\r\n1. it's alot of magic and things easily break just by renaming a class or method\r\n2. it's hard to understand, document and maintain\r\n3. it does not work with the new best practice of symfony to not suffix your contoller actions with `*Action` because of https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/blob/1665b98c6543cf52699f6a1558121ca54c7565b2/Routing/Loader/Reader/RestActionReader.php#L475-L477\r\nBut we also cannot really remove this limitation because it would automagically create routes for methods you might not want, like setters if you use setter injection in some places\r\n4. it does not work with `controller.service_arguments`, see #1807\r\n5. there are so many issues and edge cases with this\r\n    - #1759 is a huge problem. but it cannot really be changed without breaking bc. if we change the route names, it would be a bc break.\r\n    - #1953\r\n    - #1837 and #1733\r\n    - #1808\r\n    - #1789\r\n    - #1310 \r\n    - #1657\r\n\r\nSo I'd like a way to use the RestBundle routing features like \r\n- `FOS\\RestBundle\\Controller\\Annotations\\Get` and all the other method shortcuts \r\n- `FOS\\RestBundle\\Controller\\Annotations\\Version` \r\n- adding the format to the routes path\r\n\r\nBut without the route magic of creating routes based on class/method names. So routes need to be created explicitly using the symfony core routing annotations or the fos rest bundle shortcuts. This also means no more\r\n- `FOS\\RestBundle\\Controller\\Annotations\\RouteResource`\r\n- `FOS\\RestBundle\\Routing\\ClassResourceInterface`\r\n\r\nWe could either deprecate this magic or create a config option to disable it.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu/issues/3175","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu/issues/3175/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu/issues/3175/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu/issues/3175/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sulu/sulu/issues/3175","id":204625627,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDQ2MjU2Mjc=","number":3175,"title":"Blocks property for live-preview throws errors - google validator","user":{"login":"dmetzler1988","id":8446518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDY1MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8446518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmetzler1988","html_url":"https://github.com/dmetzler1988","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmetzler1988/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmetzler1988/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmetzler1988/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmetzler1988/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmetzler1988/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmetzler1988/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmetzler1988/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmetzler1988/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmetzler1988/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-01T16:04:58Z","updated_at":"2019-11-21T14:43:02Z","closed_at":"2019-11-21T14:43:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"| Q | A\r\n| --- | ---\r\n| Bug?

A Kernel Manager would know which kernel to use when a request reaches Sulu, would know which Kernel to use in console.\n\nA possible (already used implementation):\n\n``` php\n<?php\n\nuse Sulu\\Component\\HttpKernel\\SuluKernel;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request;\n\nfinal class KernelManager\n{\n    /**\n     * @var array\n     */\n    private $kernels = [\n        SuluKernel::CONTEXT_ADMIN => AdminKernel::class,\n        SuluKernel::CONTEXT_WEBSITE => WebsiteKernel::class,\n    ];\n\n    /**\n     * @var string\n     */\n    private $environment;\n\n    /**\n     * @var bool\n     */\n    private $debug;\n\n    /**\n     * @param string $environment\n     * @param bool $debug\n     */\n    public function __construct($environment, $debug)\n    {\n        $this->environment = $environment;\n        $this->debug = $debug;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Creates a kernel for the console.\n     *\n     * @param InputInterface $input\n     *\n     * @return AppKernel\n     *\n     * @throws \\RuntimeException\n     */\n    public function createConsoleKernel(InputInterface $input)\n    {\n        $context = $input->getParameterOption(['--context', '-c'], getenv('SULU_CONTEXT') ?: SuluKernel::CONTEXT_ADMIN);\n\n        return $this->createKernelFromContext($context);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Creates a kernel based on request info.\n     *\n     * @param Request $request\n     *\n     * @return AppKernel\n     *\n     * @throws \\RuntimeException\n     */\n    public function createKernelFromRequest(Request $request)\n    {\n        $context = $request->server->get(\n            'SULU_CONTEXT',\n            0 === strpos($request->getPathInfo(), '/admin') ?

This should look something like this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nreturn [\r\n    'admin' => [\r\n        'excluded_bundles' => [\r\n            'Symfony\\\\Cmf\\\\Bundle\\\\RoutingBundle\\\\CmfRoutingBundle',\r\n        ],\r\n    ],\r\n    'website' => [\r\n        'excluded_bundles' => [\r\n            'Sulu\\\\Bundle\\\\AdminBundle\\\\SuluAdminBundle',\r\n            'Symfony\\\\Bundle\\\\SecurityBundle\\\\SecurityBundle',\r\n        ],\r\n    ],\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file would also have to be read and filter the bundles by the `Kernel`. The main problem I see here is how to fill this file. From what I've seen a bundle recipe can only copy entire files, all other options like `bundles`, which touch existing files, have a specific key in the `manifest.json` file, which we probably can't touch (except there will be some extension points I don't know about).\r\n\r\nOtherwise this would be a manual step that has to be done after installing, which somehow contradicts the whole point of Symfony Flex (although it might still be a little easier). Apart from that we should not forget that this is not only about registering bundles, but also about loading configuration and routing files.\r\n\r\n## Single Kernel Setup\r\n\r\nThis would probably be the approach closest to Symfony flex, according to this [comment](https://github.com/symfony/flex/issues/110#issuecomment-309833181).\r\n\r\nWe could make a single kernel setup, and avoid having a session started on the website as described in the [documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/session/avoid_session_start.html). I think not starting a session is one of our main reasons to have multiple kernels. A problem that would still remain is the growing size of the container. If that is a problem it would be a good idea to split it in two separate applications, and we could recommend to only do that if necessary. That would make DX a bit better, i.e. we would only have one console per application, and it cannot happen that commands have to be executed twice (at least not per application, but executing them in the other application as well might be easier to understand).\r\n\r\nI think it should not be a big deal to support both approaches ONCE we've changed our architecture to be more modular.

One thing I'm was not quite happy with during my experimentation though, is the list-centric backend interface, which does not seem ideally suited for hierarchical content.\n\nA tree view would be much better suited. If I'm not mistaken, currently the only way to get a tree view without defining custom templates and controllers, is to use the dashboard tree block provided with this bundle. This tree is really quite nice, esspecially as it allows reordering of tree nodes. There are some problems with this approach though:\n- It's difficult to have multiple trees on seperate pages without resorting to custom templates and controllers. I'd prefer having a separate content tree, menu tree, route tree etc., rather than having them all in one tree.\n- If you want to add nodes to a tree, you still end up going through the sonata list style interfaces, complicating the user experience unnecessarily.\n\nI would propose something like `TreeAdmin` and `TreeNodeAdmin`.\n\n`TreeAdmin` would be responsible for a tree view. The tree view could include:\n- The tree with a specified root node. This can probably just use the tree block already provided by this bundle.\n- A 'Node creation'  side menu, which lists the nodes that can be created for this tree with 'Add new' links.\n\n`TreeAdmin` services can be added to Sonata groups and show up in the Sonata admin list block or in the dashboard side-menu with a 'Tree' link which takes you to the tree view.\n\n`TreeNodeAdmin` would be responsible for the CRUD of nodes for the tree. It takes care of the form, show, delete etc views for a tree node. It could basically be the current phpcr admin class, with the difference that a parent `TreeAdmin` needs to be specified. The views would differ from the sonata list style views in:\n- Breadcrumbs include a link to the parent tree view, instead of a list view.\n- Buttons like 'Create and return to list' are changed to 'Create and return to tree'.\n\nI'd be willing to look into implementing something like this. If I'd ever end up making a proper CMS with the CMF, this is probably what I would do anyway, but I figured this may be a generic enough problem that there would be upstream interest. Before I get started though, I'm curious as to what sentiments here are for something like this and if perhaps there's better ideas for the implementation than what I came up with above.\n\nOne issue I already ran into when playing around with this, is the somewhat 'monolithic' nature of the sonata `Admin` class (and by extension the Phpcr `Admin` class which inherits from it). It includes a lot of cruft relating to list view specifics and it feels a little wrong to extend it for something like `TreeAdmin` or `TreeNodeAdmin`. A lot of logic (e.g. for routing and security) would however be shared. I'd prefer it if there was a base admin class that is view agnostic. It seems that would be a pretty big refactor for the SonataAdminBundle though.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard/issues/568","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard/issues/568/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard/issues/568/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard/issues/568/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sulu/sulu-standard/issues/568","id":119986268,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMTk5ODYyNjg=","number":568,"title":"nothing in the admin part","user":{"login":"jelti","id":11663571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYzNTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11663571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jelti","html_url":"https://github.com/jelti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jelti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jelti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jelti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jelti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jelti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jelti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jelti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jelti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jelti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48011470,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODAxMTQ3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu-standard/labels/Question","name":"Question","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2015-12-02T16:50:21Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T14:42:58Z","closed_at":"2016-01-07T08:04:27Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hello guys\nthank you for the great work\ni just installed the sulu project by following the instructions on the guide\nthe portal can be viewed without problem when i try to go to the admin part.

the moment, some people install Sulu by cloning Sulu Standard. They update their application by pulling from the original repo and resolving any conflicts. (approach A)\n\nOthers bootstrap their application by taking Sulu Standard, but getting rid of the relationship to the original repository. The snapshot of Sulu Standard at the time of creating the project is the first commit in such a repository. Updates are performed by checking out diffs between individual Sulu versions and applying them manually. (approach B)\n\nBoth approaches have benefits and downsides. Let's try to enumerate them:\n#### Approach A: Sulu Standard as base Git repository\n##### Advantages\n- Relatively easy to perform updates\n##### Disadvantages\n- Impossible to distinguish recommended/optional from mandatory changes when updating\n- The development of Sulu Standard is constrained by BC considerations. For example, it cannot be easily simplified (https://github.com/sulu-io/sulu/issues/2078) in order to provide a better experience for starters.\n#### Approach B: Sulu Standard as project template\n##### Advantages\n- Sulu Standard can be optimized in order to provide the best experience for newcomers\n- Sulu Standard can be changed. It could always reflect the current best practice for _starting_ a new project.\n##### Disadvantages\n- Updates become more complicated since diffs need to be created and applied manually. This could be mitigated by providing a `sulu:upgrade` command that performs some changes automatically.\n\nBoth styles have different implications on the changes we can do to this repository with regard to BC:\n- https://github.com/sulu-io/sulu/issues/2078 (and others linked in there)\n- https://github.com/sulu-io/sulu-standard/issues/458\n- https://github.com/sulu-io/sulu-standard/issues/546\n\nI think we should make a decision here.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu/issues/1757","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu/issues/1757/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu/issues/1757/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sulu/sulu/issues/1757/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sulu/sulu/issues/1757","id":115832937,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMTU4MzI5Mzc=","number":1757,"title":"Use
