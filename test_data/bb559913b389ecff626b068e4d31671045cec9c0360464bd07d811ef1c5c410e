Any kind of Javascript is executed on browsers of users who access to crafted blog post page.\r\n\r\nLet me show how to reproduce it.\r\n 1.  Acces to 「/admin/blog/post/edit」\r\n 2. set blog  title as following \r\n\r\n```html\r\nstub-title<script>alert(0);</script>\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"1080\" alt=\"image1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1528031/37154873-af790fa0-2324-11e8-889a-0519ddd2f978.png\">\r\n\r\n3. Save the blog and publish it.\r\n4. Back to Blog list page 「/Pagekit/admin/blog/post?page=0」\r\n5. Access to the blog url 「/blog/1」　as following image\r\n<img width=\"1027\" alt=\"image2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1528031/37185107-1844ad5c-2382-11e8-85f7-b7c48a2b1271.png\">\r\n\r\n6. dialog appears and says as 「XSS」\r\n<img width=\"1078\" alt=\"2018-03-08 20 53 53\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1528031/37186550-7cb8fdcc-2389-11e8-816f-1db76ae58433.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you reproduce Stored XSS issue is in the blog title.\r\n\r\n## Consideration\r\nWhen an attacker uses this security issue for an attack, he is required to be authorized.

ody":"## Problem\r\n\r\non my local test installation I mentioned that a declared module config (in this case: an array) is not overwritten properly:\r\n```\r\n'config' => [\r\n   'items_per_page'         => 20,\r\n   'items'             => [ 'apple', 'banana', 'mango' ]\r\n]\r\n```\r\nNow I got a view in my admin-area where I can add or remove items of `config.items`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmethods: {\r\n\r\n    save: function () {\r\n        this.$http.post('admin/abc/save', {config: this.config}, function () {\r\n            this.$notify('Settings saved.');\r\n        }).error(function (data) {\r\n            this.$notify(data, 'danger');\r\n        });\r\n    },\r\n    add: function add(e) {\r\n        e.preventDefault();\r\n        if (!this.newItem) return;\r\n        this.config.items.push(this.newItem);\r\n        this.newItem = '';\r\n    },\r\n    remove: function (item) {\r\n        this.config.items.$remove(item);\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * @Request({\"config\": \"array\"}, csrf=true)\r\n * @param array $config\r\n *\r\n * @return array\r\n */\r\npublic function saveAction( $config = [] )\r\n{\r\n   App::config()->set( 'abc', $config );\r\n   \r\n   return [ 'message' => 'success' ];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now it becomes strange: If I delete all items, the array `config.items` is empty`[]`. But if I save and reload the site, all items I declared in the `index.php` are there again.\r\n\r\nSo this is not really good, because the items in the `index.php` are only meant as default values, but the user should be able to overwrite them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n\r\n- Pagekit version: 1.0.11\r\n- Webserver: Apache 2.4\r\n- Database: SQLite\r\n- PHP Version:
