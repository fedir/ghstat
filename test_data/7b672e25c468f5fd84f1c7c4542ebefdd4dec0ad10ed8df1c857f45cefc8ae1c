One of use cases is a sudden load spike for short period of time like 4 hours 2 days per week. For the use case, I am trying to optimize performance of the API in various parts as much as I can. A a part of the optimization, I would like to incorporate HttpRouter in gizmo Sever. Based on the benchmarks of various Go http routers (https://github.com/julienschmidt/go-http-routing-benchmark), HttpRouter shows very good performance with very low heap allocation rate. At this point, SimpleServer uses Gorilla mux as a http router. To use HttpRouter, it needs FastSimpleServer , which is planned this year per http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/introducing-gizmo. I am looking forward to adding FastSimpleServer with HttpRouter to gizmo for those who want HttpRouter as a http router.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NYTimes/gizmo/issues/36","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NYTimes/gizmo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NYTimes/gizmo/issues/36/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NYTimes/gizmo/issues/36/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NYTimes/gizmo/issues/36/events","html_url":"https://github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/issues/36","id":142095927,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNDIwOTU5Mjc=","number":36,"title":"server.MonitorRPCRequest() does not write to the RPCAccessLog","user":{"login":"labkode","id":5175912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzU5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5175912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/labkode","html_url":"https://github.com/labkode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labkode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labkode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labkode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labkode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labkode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labkode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labkode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labkode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labkode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-19T19:53:22Z","updated_at":"2016-03-19T20:11:26Z","closed_at":"2016-03-19T20:11:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Still playing with the RPC example I have discovered that the [server.MonitorRPCRequest()](https://github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/blob/master/examples/servers/rpc/service/mostpopular.go#L18) does not write to the RPC log file. \n\nAny hint about a possible solution ?
