I think it should be renamed as `enqueueState`, or `queueState`, or `pushState`, or something on those lines. Perhaps, someone else can come up with a nicer name?\r\n\r\nI've seen even people quite experienced in React to make the rookie mistake now and then, of doing `setState` like it's a synchronous function, and then go bug-hunting.

Until today I assumed that meant \"ah, React 16.2 introduced some clever new tech that obviated the need for keys\". But I learned today that that is not the case. Right now, I believe you can make a dynamic list of elements, throw it in a fragment, and get no key warning message – but have bad performance and non-stable updates.\r\n\r\nAs best as I can tell, the reason for the difference in behavior is that fragments are _expected_ to be understood as having a different semantic meaning than arrays, to be used for static content only. But if we're relying on that expectation to avoid a major gotcha, I would assume it would be explicitly mentioned in the docs for fragments, and prominently featured in a warning-style yellow box. Instead, I don't believe it's mentioned at all.\r\n\r\nThe dual behaviors make a lot of sense to me (if React can't figure out on its own whether siblings need keys, it's great for us to have a way to explicitly tell it when they do or don't) but it seems to me that such an important and subtle nuance would call for a lot of documentation and instead has none that I can find.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I've misunderstood any of this – I figure that's more likely than not 😅 ","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12775","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12775/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12775/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12775/events","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12775","id":321851605,"number":12775,"title":"Getting error while using component into another component in separate files","user":{"login":"farhanali2325","id":29413411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29413411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhanali2325","html_url":"https://github.com/farhanali2325","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhanali2325/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhanali2325/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhanali2325/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhanali2325/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhanali2325/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhanali2325/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhanali2325/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhanali2325/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhanali2325/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-05-10T08:29:34Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T10:02:32Z","closed_at":"2018-05-10T08:50:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n![screenshot from 2018-05-10 13-17-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29413411/39859788-7f80d52e-5454-11e8-8b58-a7de26c674bb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'schema' of undefined**\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n** JSFiddle  https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/439/\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12774","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12774/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12774/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12774/events","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12774","id":321849408,"number":12774,"title":"this.state doesn't  get the current state properly","user":{"login":"MoamenMohamed","id":7293235,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7293235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoamenMohamed","html_url":"https://github.com/MoamenMohamed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoamenMohamed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoamenMohamed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoamenMohamed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoamenMohamed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoamenMohamed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoamenMohamed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoamenMohamed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoamenMohamed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoamenMohamed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-05-10T08:20:49Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T10:14:33Z","closed_at":"2018-05-10T08:45:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Related to this issue \r\nhttps://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/material-ui-pickers/issues/396#issuecomment-387972773\r\n\r\nI found a work around by checking the state out of the onChange.

If you intentionally need to render something different on the server and the client, you have to do a two-pass rendering like https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8017#issuecomment-256351955\r\n\r\nIf an attribute is derived from screen size, since we don't know the real screen size in the server side, we might do a 2 pass rendering like following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nconstructor(props) {\r\n  super(props)\r\n  this.state = { hasMounted: false }\r\n  \r\n  this.styles = Object.defineProperties({}, {\r\n    'container': { get: _=> {\r\n       if (typeof window == 'undefined') return { height: 300 }\r\n       let height = this.props.viewsize.height * 0.67\r\n       return this.state.hasMounted ? { height } : { height: height - 1 }\r\n    }}\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\ncomponentDidMount() {\r\n    this.setState({ hasMounted: true })\r\n}\r\n\r\nrender() {\r\n  let s = this.styles\r\n  return (\r\n    <div  style={s['container']}>\r\n  </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the above code, I demonstrate that I have to intentionally render a wrong height initially in the browser so I can update it in the second run.

Very useful for declaring SVG filters but can be combined with anything else including [Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html), [Fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) and so on.\r\n\r\n## Use Case\r\nWe have a Ripple component similar to [Material-UI](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/paper-ripple) which could get applied to anything including a `div` and a `button`. Our Ripple effect makes use of an SVG filter for a [gooey effect](https://css-tricks.com/gooey-effect). It's easy for us to bake the SVG into the Ripple component but we only need the SVG rendered once, anywhere in the DOM.\r\n\r\nWe make use of the Singleton component to handle rendering this SVG once and when the component rendering the SVG gets destroyed, the responsibility falls upon the next component in the list, if any.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n```jsx\r\nconst FilterSingleton = React.createSingleton();\r\n\r\nconst FancyEffect = () =>\r\n{\r\n\treturn (\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<FilterSingleton>\r\n\t\t\t\t<svg className='svg-defs' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<defs><filter id='can-be-used-anywhere'></filter></defs>\r\n\t\t\t\t</svg>\r\n\t\t\t</FilterSingleton>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<SomeComponent ... />\r\n\t\t\t<SomeComponent ... />\r\n\t\t\t<SomeComponent ... />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t);\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Used all throughout your application but SVG is only rendered at most once on the DOM\r\n<FancyEffect />\r\n<FancyEffect />\r\n<FancyEffect />\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n```jsx\r\nReact.createSingleton = function()\r\n{\r\n\tconst instances = [ ];\r\n\r\n\treturn class Singleton extends PureComponent\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tconstructor (props) {\r\n\t\t\tsuper (props);\r\n\t\t\tinstances.push (this);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tcomponentWillUnmount() {\r\n\t\t\tconst index = instances.indexOf (this);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif (index > -1) {\r\n\t\t\t\tinstances.splice (index, 1);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif (instances[0]) {\r\n\t\t\t\tinstances[0].forceUpdate();\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\trender() {\r\n\t\t\treturn instances[0] === this ? this.props.children : null;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n};\r\n```","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12741","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12741/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12741/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12741/events","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12741","id":320313548,"number":12741,"title":"Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `someProp`","user":{"login":"jpggvilaca","id":8736279,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8736279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpggvilaca","html_url":"https://github.com/jpggvilaca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpggvilaca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpggvilaca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpggvilaca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpggvilaca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpggvilaca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpggvilaca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpggvilaca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpggvilaca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpggvilaca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-05-04T15:13:24Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T16:50:41Z","closed_at":"2018-05-04T16:42:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nReport\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWhen I pass a boolean prop, say:\r\n\r\n```<SomeComponent enable />``` I get this warning for the `enable` prop, this wasn't happening in React 15.x.

I've been using the new context API a bit and noticed myself repeating a pattern. A lot of my components look something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst MyContext = React.createContext('foo');\r\n\r\nconst MyComponent = ({ ownProp }) => (\r\n  <MyContext.Consumer>\r\n    { myProp => <div>{ myProp }{ ownProp }</div>\r\n  </MyContext.Consumer>\r\n);\r\nexport default MyComponent;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis got me to wondering. What if the Consumer could be exposed as a HOC?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst MyContext = React.createContext('foo');\r\n\r\nconst MyComponent = ({ myProp, ownProp }) => (\r\n  <div>{ myProp }{ ownProp }</div>\r\n);\r\nexport default MyContext.isConsumedBy(MyComponent);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is similar to ```connect``` from redux or ```withRouter``` from react-router in which the context value(s) are being injected by a HOC. I can write my own HOC to do this using the existing Consumer component from the Context API - but thought I'd put this out here for possible inclusion in the API itself.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst isConsumedBy = Wrapped => props => (\r\n  <MyContext.Consumer>\r\n    { myProp => <Wrapped myProp={myProp} {...props} /> }\r\n  </MyContext.Consumer>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12723","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12723/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12723/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12723/events","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12723","id":319106603,"number":12723,"title":"The findByType method from react-test-renderer doesn't find ref-forwarding components","user":{"login":"p-jackson","id":1500769,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1500769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/p-jackson","html_url":"https://github.com/p-jackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p-jackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p-jackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p-jackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p-jackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p-jackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p-jackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p-jackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p-jackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p-jackson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-05-01T03:41:45Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T11:49:19Z","closed_at":"2018-05-01T11:49:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn tests, if the component passed to `root.findByType` was created using `forwardRef` it can't be found.\r\n\r\nIf I use `root.find` to loop over all the nodes and log `.type` I see that the ref-forwarding-component is skipped entirely.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.
