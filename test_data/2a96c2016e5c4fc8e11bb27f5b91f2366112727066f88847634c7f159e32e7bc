Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.4.0\r\n\r\nI have a few questions before I try to solve this problem and it gets rejected. I'm assuming that the team has decided to move in the direction of removing \"Will-Updates\" from React all together and have labeled them \"Unsafe\". I've seen a lot of issues with those functionalities before as well. I was curious if providing a conditional statement inside those functions would satisfy the unexpected renders. \"shouldComponentUpdate\" does trigger when to call these functions however in those functions that \"will\" run before the render can always be controlled with a conditional statement of it's own. I'm getting comfortable with the code base however I'm curious if the team is removing that functionality all together and using the \"static\" function \"getDerivedStateFromProps\" instead. Has a React lover it is a little confusing and may break a lot of legacy code when updating versions. I believe that may solve the problem of unexpected renders after a \"will\" change lifecycle event.\r\n\r\nI was curious if that was the case, and removing \"will\" lifecycles is the next steps for React then how will the \"did\" lifecycles work instead?\r\n\r\nI love React and I'm just curious about the future for React as a whole. I'd love to tackle any bugs or feature requests when I have time.

The descendant component always reads a context value from its closest ancestor's context value.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nHave another new Context API support context scopes chaining/cascading, components read context from bottom to up, and contexts could be shadowed by any components. This API also prevent the old Context API (React 16- ) issues (e.g. update blocking).\r\n\r\nA reasonable situation is like:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Layout theme=\"primary\">              // primary\r\n    <Header>                          // primary\r\n        <Button />                    // primary\r\n    </Header>\r\n    <Main>                            // primary\r\n        <Button theme=\"warning\" />    // warning\r\n    </Main>\r\n    <Footer theme=\"danger\" >          // danger\r\n        <Button />                    // danger\r\n    </Footer>\r\n</Layout>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith such a Context Api,  we can have a components libarary that once setted a scoped 'theme' context, the 'theme' effects all its children. We also can use it control the scope 'size', scope 'privilege', scope 'locale', and any other scope behaviours.\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12971","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12971/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12971/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12971/events","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12971","id":328773114,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjg3NzMxMTQ=","number":12971,"title":"question re: a few lines in ReactFiberScheduler.js","user":{"login":"nateq314","id":1175921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzU5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1175921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nateq314","html_url":"https://github.com/nateq314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nateq314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nateq314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nateq314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nateq314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nateq314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nateq314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nateq314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nateq314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nateq314/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-06-02T20:04:58Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T18:03:37Z","closed_at":"2018-06-07T18:03:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nNeither, just wanted to ask a question about the code, specifically this function in `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberScheduler.js`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction computeAsyncExpiration(currentTime: ExpirationTime) {\r\n  // Given the current clock time, returns an expiration time.
