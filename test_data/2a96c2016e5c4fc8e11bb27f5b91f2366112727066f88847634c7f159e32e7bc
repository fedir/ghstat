Then in the screen file for each tab, I detect if we're on the correct index and if so, load a value from storage and then fetch some data from an API. Here's how I'm currently doing this inside the tab's screen:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps (newProps) {\r\n    if (newProps.screenProps.route_index === 2) {\r\n      AsyncStorage.getItem('MyBar')\r\n      .then(myBarID => {\r\n        if (myBarID) {\r\n          GetBars(myBarID, (err, bars) => {\r\n            if (err) {\r\n              console.error(err)\r\n            } else if (bars && bars.length) {\r\n              this.setState(prev => {\r\n                prev.loadingBar = false\r\n                prev.myBar = bars[0]\r\n                return prev\r\n              })\r\n            }\r\n          })\r\n        }\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut using the new `getDerivedStateFromProps` static function, it doesn't seem to be able to update the state within AsyncStorage or Fetch (`GetBars` is an imported service which is just a wrapper function for a fetch call against an API):\r\n\r\n```\r\n  static getDerivedStateFromProps (newProps, prevState) {\r\n    if (newProps.screenProps.route_index === 2) {\r\n      AsyncStorage.getItem('MyBar')\r\n      .then(myBarID => {\r\n        if (myBarID) {\r\n          GetBars(myBarID, (err, bars) => {\r\n            if (err) {\r\n              console.error(err)\r\n              return null\r\n            } else if (bars && bars.length) {\r\n              return { loadingBar: false, myBar: bars[0] }\r\n            } else {\r\n              return null\r\n            }\r\n          })\r\n        } else {\r\n          return null\r\n        }\r\n      })\r\n    } else {\r\n      return null\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried using `componentWillMount`, but it only fires the first time the tab is loaded. I need to do an Storage and API call every time the user changes to a tab.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12593","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12593/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12593/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12593/events","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12593","id":312940639,"number":12593,"title":"Getting SHA384 warning after switching from development to production","user":{"login":"dkati","id":12833390,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12833390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkati","html_url":"https://github.com/dkati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkati/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-04-10T14:11:04Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T10:03:14Z","closed_at":"2018-04-10T14:14:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"`\r\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.2.0/umd/react.production.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.2.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.25.0/babel.min.js\"></script>\r\n`\r\nhere are my scripts that i include to my html and i get \r\n\r\n`None of the “sha384” hashes in the integrity attribute match the content of the subresource.`\r\n\r\nany thoughts? thanks ","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12592","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12592/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12592/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/12592/events","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12592","id":312940522,"number":12592,"title":"Add unicityKey to save react from rendering subpart of the DOM when it hasn't changed","user":{"login":"bebeun","id":11339074,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11339074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bebeun","html_url":"https://github.com/bebeun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bebeun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bebeun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bebeun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bebeun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bebeun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bebeun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bebeun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bebeun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bebeun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-10T14:10:48Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T14:26:28Z","closed_at":"2018-04-10T14:26:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"==> New feature proposal\r\n\r\nToday, if we want to save react from re rendering a sub part of a parent component1, we have no other choice but to create a component2 nested in component1 and implement shouldComponentUpdate for component2.\r\n\r\nIt is very useful. But in my case, my apps are very little likely to be written with multiple nested components since every DOM part is unique. Splitting my app into components would be very verbose.\r\nSo I only have a main component for a page with an inline DOM in the render function. But at the same time, depending on my app state, there are big DOM nodes I could save from rerendering.\r\n\r\nMy idea is to be able to use a kind of \"unicityKey\" that would tell react \"Okay, the unicityKey has not changed\", no need to go any deeper in this node, it is unchanged.\r\nFor example : \r\n\r\n    <div unicityKey={this.state.stuff} key={\"divNumber3\"} >\r\n        ...\r\n
