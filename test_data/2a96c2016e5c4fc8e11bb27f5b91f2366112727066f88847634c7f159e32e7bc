The first one is that it breaks the single source of truth rule (and we also have the inconvenience of keeping props.currentRow and state.lastRow in sync), and the second one I think is summarized here: https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html i.e. *The key here is DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand*.

See https://jsfiddle.net/rv9jtfy4/ in order to reproduce it. Click on the header to trigger the warnings. When this example is running React 15, no warnings/issues are present.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the `unmountComponentAtNode` function unmounts the component asynchronously during an event. When debugging, after executing the method the root is still populated with HTML and internal React properties are still present. This probably makes the following `React.render` call problematic.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.

This means that the second argument to it should be allowed to be undefined, as it would be on the first call if state is not initialized by the user. This change would not be a breaking change, as it depends on the user breaking from the pattern of initializing state in the constructor, although it brings memories of `createClass`'s `getInitialState`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it should not be called on initial render, and the class implementer would call its own getDerivedStateFromProps and spread its result on its initial state definition.
