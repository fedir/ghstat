Description\r\nThere seems to be a long running issue with several iterations of fixes for streaming of different types of JSON data:\r\n- The [6156](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6156) was the original issue which made the internal index reset together with resetting the decoder state, but it did not cover the case with streaming arrays.\r\n- The [6969](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6969) fixed the problem with arrays, but did not cover the case with streaming objects.\r\n- The [7722](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7722) is a (currently) opened issue which fixes the problem with streaming objects. While the described solution seems to workaround the problem, it causes multiple reads of the same bytes and technically does not fully recover the state (different branches are executed for the repeated reads).\r\n\r\nA better approach seems to be to just properly recover the internal decoder index given the information about how far the decoder went from the readerIndex and the last readerIndex are already there which seems to cover both the cases with streaming arrays and objects.\r\n\r\n### Netty
