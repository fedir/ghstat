forwarding to Server Y. This load is no more than 10% of the load we take normally. But with new load we are seeing the memory leak.\r\nThe only thing different about this load is that we are not protected for slow clients and slow server that we are proxying to. \r\nWe are going to patch to code to not read from client when the Proxy or Write side is not writeable but will take some time to roll that code out. \r\nIn the meantime what can we do to disable this direct buffer or whatever is using non-jvm heap memory to not have JVM heap side grow. \r\nI have changed the setting for advance leak detection and will be happy to paste the output for you once I gather the data.

Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNot throwing unhandled `UnsupportedOperationException`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nMethod throws unhandled `UnsupportedOperationException` which causes channel write operations to fail.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThe problem is here: https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/transport-native-unix-common/src/main/java/io/netty/channel/unix/IovArray.java#L96\r\n\r\nIf `buf` is a `FixedCompositeByteBuf` with one direct buffer component, it will return `nioBufferCount() == 1` and `memoryAddress()` will throw `UnsupportedOperationException`. \r\n\r\nI can see two possible, complimentary fixes:\r\n\r\n1. Make `memoryAddress()` work for composites that are one direct buffer\r\n2. Change this if branch condition to `buf.nioBufferCount() == 1 && buf.hasMemoryAddress()`\r\n\r\nHere's a stack trace showing the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\nio.netty.channel.socket.ChannelOutputShutdownException: Channel output shutdown\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannel$AbstractUnsafe.shutdownOutput(AbstractChannel.java:641)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannel$AbstractUnsafe.flush0(AbstractChannel.java:948)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.epoll.AbstractEpollChannel$AbstractEpollUnsafe.flush0(AbstractEpollChannel.java:543)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannel$AbstractUnsafe.flush(AbstractChannel.java:901)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.DefaultChannelPipeline$HeadContext.flush(DefaultChannelPipeline.java:1321)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeFlush0(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:776)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeFlush(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:768)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.flush(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:749)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.CombinedChannelDuplexHandler$DelegatingChannelHandlerContext.flush(CombinedChannelDuplexHandler.java:533)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter.flush(ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter.java:115)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.CombinedChannelDuplexHandler.flush(CombinedChannelDuplexHandler.java:358)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeFlush0(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:776)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeFlush(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:768)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.flush(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:749)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.ChannelDuplexHandler.flush(ChannelDuplexHandler.java:117)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeFlush0(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:776)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeWriteAndFlush(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:802)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.write(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:814)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.writeAndFlush(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:794)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.writeAndFlush(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:831)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.DefaultChannelPipeline.writeAndFlush(DefaultChannelPipeline.java:1041)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannel.writeAndFlush(AbstractChannel.java:300)\r\n\tat ratpack.http.client.internal.RequestActionSupport.lambda$send$4(RequestActionSupport.java:137)\r\n\tat io.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.notifyListener0(DefaultPromise.java:507)\r\n\tat io.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.notifyListenerWithStackOverFlowProtection(DefaultPromise.java:450)\r\n\tat io.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.notifyListener(DefaultPromise.java:409)\r\n\tat io.netty.util.concurrent.CompleteFuture.addListener(CompleteFuture.java:49)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.CompleteChannelFuture.addListener(CompleteChannelFuture.java:56)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.CompleteChannelFuture.addListener(CompleteChannelFuture.java:27)\r\n\tat ratpack.http.client.internal.RequestActionSupport.send(RequestActionSupport.java:135)\r\n\tat ratpack.http.client.internal.RequestActio
