To send a mail, a worker thread calls the slot Mailer::sendMail() as a normal member function. To execute Mailer::sendMail() in the correct threading context I check thread() against QThread::currentThread() and if they disagree, I call QMetaObject::invokeMethod() with an explicit Qt::QueuedConnection flag.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly standard and proven and simple procedure to make sure the function is executing in its own thread.\r\n\r\nNow the problem with cutelyst:\r\n\r\nIf I call the Hello application like this:\r\n`cutelyst-wsgi2 --application BUILD/src/libHello.so --threads 2 --processes 0 --h1 0.0.0.0:8080`\r\nEverything is working and I get the log message `96910:96911 Mailer[debug] void Mailer::sendMail(QString, QString, QVariantHash) now running in correct thread` as expected.\r\n\r\nBut, if I call the Hello application like this:\r\n`cutelyst-wsgi2 --application BUILD/src/libHello.so --threads 2 --h1 0.0.0.0:8080 --master`\r\nCutelyst forks to create a child (children). BTW most combinations of --threads and --processes result in an abort `98312:98312 wsgi.tcp_server_balancer[critical] Failed to bind to socket 9`, but that is another problem. Using the fork option, the function is no longer executed correctly.\r\n\r\nWhy has forking an impact on internal event creation/delivery with QMetaObject::invokeMethod()?\r\n\r\nI'm totally lost here. Do you have an idea what's going on here?\r\n\r\nCutelyst v2.12.0 (happens with older, too)\r\nQt 5.12.8 (happens with older, too)\r\nUbuntu 20.04 (happens with 18.04, too)\r\n\r\nJust to recap the main point: QMetaObject::invokeMethod() returns true, i.e. it says it created the event to call the function and the function exists, but it is never called. I also created a timer running inside the thread, to check, if event loop dispatching is working correctly; it is.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cutelyst/cutelyst/issues/269","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cutelyst/cutelyst","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cutelyst/cutelyst/issues/269/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cutelyst/cutelyst/issues/269/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cutelyst/cutelyst/issues/269/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cutelyst/cutelyst/issues/269","id":661332495,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NjEzMzI0OTU=","number":269,"title":"[Feature

I have a couple of threads which must be gently terminated in the Controller slot `slotShutdown()` linked with `Application::shutdown`.  I have typical worker objects (`QObject` descendants) and corresponding `QThread`s. I emit `finalize()` signal within `slotShutdown()`. Then I periodically check worker object atomic bool flag isFinalized in a loop. I quit worker `QThread` after that. \r\nAFAIK, I cannot rely on other slots within Controller after `Application::shutdown`, that's why I have to check other workers state in a loop using synchronized flag. But I expect that eventloops of other threads are still working when I emit signal within Controller `slotShutdown()`.  \r\nSometimes the signal is not catched within worker objects, so the loop is eternal. What can be done? \r\nI don't want to call methods of worker objects within Controller thread, because I've got Qt warnings about killing timers in the wrong threads etc.\r\nBTW, I've used single

REST service will be used in local network, I'd like to avoid Apache and other reverse proxies.\r\nWhat will you advise? For example, is it reasonable to make a thin system service based on `QtService` that will in turn start cutelyst-wsgi2? I suppose that in-source mixing cutelyst-wsgi2  and `QtService` will be hard according to [`main.cpp`](https://github.com/cutelyst/cutelyst/blob/master/wsgi/main.cpp) contents. For example, cutelyst-wsgi2 has own calls to `QCoreApplication::exec()`. Also, I don't want to fork multiple cutelyst-wsgi2 processes (so, I choose only a restricted subset of cutelyst-wsgi2 features - multithreaded, but single process). \r\nBTW, what's the difference between https://github.com/qtproject/qt-solutions/tree/master/qtservice and your project?","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cutelyst/cutelyst/issues/143","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cutelyst/cutelyst","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cutelyst/cutelyst/issues/143/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cutelyst/cutelyst/issues/143/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cutelyst/cutelyst/issues/143/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cutelyst/cutelyst/issues/143","id":376075360,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzYwNzUzNjA=","number":143,"title":"add
