Having them removed from the parent project means would not have the flexibility to move between DB providers without rearchitecting when they are eventually removed from maintained couchdb and cloudant versions. The couchdb and cloudant projects are where I'd be wanting to run to for hosting my data if pouchdb isn't stable or maintained.\r\n\r\nThis issue records my requirement for update functions to inform debate if it's not already settled. I don't think I'd be able to express these in the proposed mango forms I've seen discussed.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nI have found that the ability to transform field values into other fields on insert is fairly fundamental to my app and works around the limited expressivity of Mango and potential efficiency concerns within map/reduce. There are other places the transformation could be done, but none which is as elegant and well-managed as it is within a designdoc-managed update function. I would rather not rely on the client to maintain this consistent field-duplication and mapping before insert as it's an indexing issue.\r\n\r\n## Desired Behaviour\r\n\r\nI would like the future Query server implementation and API to retain the ability to intercept document insertion and run arbitrary javascript to transform it, as per existing support in 3.0.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nIn a design I'm working on, I have been depending on the ability to run updates on incoming data in order to derive fields from source field values provided. \r\n\r\nIn this way the fields `priority` and `actionable` can be assigned and used for simple filtering and ordering later. Both fields are a mapping of existing fields, although the mapping is complex. \r\n\r\nBoth fields are intended to assist with the ordering of task data items. Priority is an integer . Actionable is a Unix epoch time in milliseconds.\r\n\r\nFrom these priority and actionable fields, several indexes can be composed via map/reduce without recalculating these values from the source fields.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, consumers will need id (for the client-side data model) and _id (for couchdb) to align, and this can be enforced here too.\r\n\r\nThis gives you a flavour...\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction save(storedDoc, req){\r\n  if (!req.body) {\r\n    return [null, \"No document\"]\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  var sentDoc = JSON.parse(req.body)\r\n  \r\n  //align '_id' field with 'id'\r\n  sentDoc._id = sentDoc.id\r\n\r\n  //project priority field\r\n  sentDoc[\"*priority\"] = getPriorityOrder(sentDoc)\r\n\r\n  //project actionable field\r\n  sentDoc[\"*actionable\"] = whenTaskActionable(sentDoc)\r\n\r\n  return [sentDoc, \"ok\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see the full implementation at https://gist.github.com/cefn/749e28f88dd5c7511dc2dd935d0381ef","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3200","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3200/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3200/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3200/events","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3200","id":716363854,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MTYzNjM4NTQ=","number":3200,"title":"boolean parameters incorrectly handled when POSTed to view-like requests","user":{"login":"ricellis","id":10698320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjk4MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10698320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricellis","html_url":"https://github.com/ricellis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricellis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricellis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricellis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricellis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricellis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricellis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricellis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricellis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricellis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":594290317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTQyOTAzMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"FF9F96","default":true,"description":""},{"id":1205319335,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjA1MzE5MzM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/labels/needs-triage","name":"needs-triage","color":"ffff33","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-10-07T09:33:18Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T19:56:40Z","closed_at":"2020-10-09T19:56:40Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"[NOTE]: # ( ^^ Provide a general summary of the issue in the title above. ^^ )\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nWhen using a `POST` with request body to pass parameters to a view-like request the boolean parameters are accepting only JSON strings, but not booleans. For example the `stable` parameter works with `\"true\"` and `\"false\"` but not `true` and `false`.\r\n\r\n[NOTE]: # ( Describe the problem you're encountering. )\r\n[TIP]:  # ( Do NOT give us access or passwords to your actual CouchDB! )\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n`POST` to a view:\r\n\r\n`curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"stable\": true}' 'https://examples.cloudant.com/animaldb/_design/views101/_view/latin_name'`\r\n```{\"error\":\"query_parse_error\",\"reason\":\"Invalid value for `stable`.\"}```\r\n\r\n`curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"stable\": \"true\"}' 'https://examples.cloudant.com/animaldb/_design/views101/_view/latin_name'`\r\n`{\"total_rows\":5,\"offset\":0,\"rows\":[...`\r\n\r\nEquivalent `GET` behaviour:\r\n`curl 'https://examples.cloudant.com/animaldb/_design/views101/_view/latin_name?stable=true'`\r\n`{\"total_rows\":5,\"offset\":0,\"rows\":[...`\r\n\r\n`curl 'https://examples.cloudant.com/animaldb/_design/views101/_view/latin_name?stable=\"true\"'`\r\n```{\"error\":\"query_parse_error\",\"reason\":\"Invalid value for `stable`.\"}```\r\n\r\n[NOTE]: # ( Include commands to reproduce, if possible. curl is preferred. )\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\n[NOTE]: # ( Tell us what you expected to happen. )\r\n\r\nExpected a `boolean` to be accepted.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n[TIP]:  # ( Include as many relevant details about your environment as possible. )\r\n[TIP]:  # ( You can paste the output of curl http://YOUR-COUCHDB:5984/ here. )\r\n\r\n* CouchDB version used:\r\n3.1.0\r\n* Browser name and version:\r\nN/A\r\n* Operating system and version:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Additional Context\r\n\r\n[TIP]:  # ( Add any other context about the problem here. )\r\n\r\nI think it would be beneficial to _both_ accept the `boolean` type _and_ continue to accept strings for two reasons:\r\n1. to avoid breaking anyone who is using the already released string form\r\n1. `update` has to accept a string for `\"lazy\"` in a JSON body - so it would be useful to accept `\"true\"` and `\"false\"` there as well to avoid interaction problems with strongly typed langauges where this property would need to be a string and not a boolean (to be able to support `lazy`).\r\n\r\nThanks to @rnewson for pointing out to me that they are being treated as strings because the support for post is currently converting the query params directly and suggesting:\r\n>normally you have to write a separate function with clauses for all the params\r\n\r\nand for proposing a test addition:\r\n```erlang\r\nbody: %{\r\n        :keys => [\"_design/foo\", \"_design/foo2\"],\r\n        :update => false\r\n      }\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb-docker/issues/191","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb-docker","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb-docker/issues/191/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb-docker/issues/191/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb-docker/issues/191/events","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb-docker/issues/191","id":703944305,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MDM5NDQzMDU=","number":191,"title":"master -> main commit for Paul ","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-09-17T22:14:20Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T13:35:13Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T13:35:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"47d2a972604e1d33969a244e46b68f45c0382390 is going to be tracked downstream by Docker so don't lose it.

# ( ^^ Provide a general summary of the issue in the title above. ^^ )\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIn the `/_system` endpoint, particularly in the `chttpd_node:get_stats/0` function, one of the data points returned is an integer reflecting the total sum of the length of all run queues [1]. With the introduction of dirty schedulers in Erlang, the `statistics(run_queue)` statistic now includes information about the depth of the dirty CPU and IO queues, however, the documentation indicates it should not be including those values. At least that's how it appears to me, I've filed a bug on the matter [2] and I'll keep an eye on that.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we can isolate the scheduler run queues from the dirty scheduler run queues, and report those values separately which will ensure we have an accurate value for `run_queue` and also allow us to introduce a new value for the dirty CPU queue.\r\n\r\nFor more context, CouchDB uses several NIFs, but none of them are dirty NIFs. However, OTP's `rsa_generate_key` function _is_ a dirty NIF [3], and will flow through the dirty NIF CPU queue. If you're using something like HAProxy for SSL termination, you won't normally encounter this, however, we can still end up making dirty NIF calls for a push replication to a remote instance over https. The end result is that the `run_queue` statistic in the `/_system` endpoint will reflect the amount of crypto work going through the dirty cpu queue and will give false positives on run_queue overload, as elevated run_queues are usually indicative of the Erlang VM having more work to handle that resources available.\r\n\r\n[NOTE]: # ( Describe the problem you're encountering. )\r\n[TIP]:  # ( Do NOT give us access or passwords to your actual CouchDB! )\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n[NOTE]: # ( Include commands to reproduce, if possible. curl is preferred. )\r\n\r\nSee the bug

Now, the problem is that I can't find any way to do this view search via a POST using cloudant.js (or nano.js).

Unable to write proper interface which is allowed by CouchDB and MongoDb references.\r\nhttp://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/database/find.html#selector-syntax\r\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/\r\n\r\n### 1. Steps to reproduce and the simplest code sample possible to demonstrate the issue\r\nOnce you have your instance for cloudant and then point to the database, in this example we are using a database called 'reservations', when we use the method 'find' it receives and object and one of those properties is selector, which receives the mangoquery to execute, there is where we cannot use reserved words from mango like $and, $eq, $lte, it throws an error when specifying them:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37992698/89443429-e1c09080-d715-11ea-8208-88f47f7dee6c.png) \r\n\r\n### 2. What you expected to happen\r\nUser should be able to use those operators without receiving an error message from them. I found that this is issue was reported and corrected directly on the Nano library, this is the reported issue: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb-nano/issues/202\r\nSo if Im not wrong it would be just a matter of updating the Nano dependency on the Cloudant project in order to resolved it, right now Im applying the changes described on that issue manually in order to let me run the queries and it works.\r\nOn the nano.d.ts file we need to change the declaration of the MangoSelector interface for this:\r\n\r\nOld code:\r\n  interface MangoSelector {\r\n    [key: string]: MangoSelector | MangoValue | MangoValue[];\r\n  }\r\n\r\nNew code:\r\n  type MangoOperator = '$regex' | '$eq' | '$gt' | '$gte' | '$lt' | '$lte' | '$ne' | '$and' | '$or' | '$not' | '$nor' | '$all' | '$elemMatch' | '$allMatch' | '$in'\r\n\r\n  interface MangoSelector {\r\n    [K in MangoOperator | string]: MangoSelector | MangoValue | MangoValue[];\r\n  }\r\n\r\n### 3. What actually happened\r\nUser receives the next error message when using the operators:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37992698/89443593-1b919700-d716-11ea-966f-e5780f40ef52.png)\r\n\r\n## Environment details\r\n- Node.js version\r\n    > 12.18.2\r\n-

Expected Behavior\r\nI'm looking for a way to run a temporary couchdb container with `single_node=true` set.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n`single_mode=false` is the default, this causes system databases to not be created and spams the log with failed access.  The default be changed without mounting a volume or creating an inherited container image.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nEnable support for `-e COUCHDB_SINGLE_NODE=true` from the initialization script.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nI'm trying to use this container as part of an automated test suite for a daemon that will use couchdb for storage.  The hope is to use the following command to start a docker container:\r\n```sh\r\npodman run \\\r\n  --rm \\\r\n  -e COUCHDB_USER=admin \\\r\n  -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=admin \\\r\n  -e COUCHDB_SINGLE_NODE=true \\\r\n  -p 127.0.0.1:5984:5984 \\\r\n  docker.io/library/couchdb:3\r\n```\r\n\r\nI attempted to mount ./fixtures/couchdb to /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d with a local.ini in that folder.  I received SELinux errors first then adding the `:Z` option to the folder mount gave an error `relabeling content in /usr is not allowed` (my code is under `/usr/src`).  I then tried using `mktemp -d` and copying my local.ini to that temp directory.  This allowed couchdb-docker to start and recognize `single_node=true` but unfortunately resulted in the temporary directory ownership being taken over (so removing it after the container runs would require sudo).\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n* Version used: 3.1.0\r\n* Browser Name and version: None\r\n* Operating System and version (desktop or mobile): Fedora 32, using podman 2.0.1.\r\n* Link to your project: N/A\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk-devtools/issues/322","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk-devtools","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk-devtools/issues/322/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk-devtools/issues/322/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk-devtools/issues/322/events","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-devtools/issues/322","id":667583360,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2Njc1ODMzNjA=","number":322,"title":"Makefile quick-start error ","user":{"login":"marquies","id":376818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjgxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/376818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marquies","html_url":"https://github.com/marquies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marquies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marquies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marquies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marquies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marquies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marquies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marquies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marquies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marquies/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2020-07-29T06:21:15Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T06:40:49Z","closed_at":"2020-08-11T06:40:49Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hey, thanks for your awesome work. \r\nI want to use the quick-start on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance.\r\n\r\nI get the same error like the travis-ci:\r\n\r\n```\r\npinging minio...\r\n ...
