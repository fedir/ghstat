of version `[http-kit \"2.5.0-alpha2\"]` [http-kit](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit) is compatible with GraalVM. In the `http-kit` branch we added the `org.httpkit.server` namespace (only the `run-server` function) and it results in only a 0.5MB increase in binary size, which seems very reasonable. Adding a web-server to babashka could be useful for small apps. Some babashka scripts have their own implementation of an http server, see examples/notes, examples/http-server and https://github.com/djblue/portal. Including a built-in webserver could make writing these apps easier, but isn't a full solution. Adding this would probably also lead to adding a routing library (compojure, reitit, etc) and perhaps more? Another idea is to implement it as a pod first.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n``` clojure\r\n(require '[org.httpkit.server :as srv]\r\n         '[clojure.java.browse :as browse])\r\n\r\n(defn app [{:keys

Wouldn't you want to have other teammates be able to quickly pull down a project and be able to run tests or the app itself locally? Sure, for a production environment, you'd want those environment variables to be separate for security and scaling. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it seems now the config edn's are separate for dev and test environments, which seems contrary to the original 12factor docs: https://12factor.net/config Looks like this was done for a separate problem too: https://github.com/luminus-framework/luminus-template/issues/292#issuecomment-354661443 and https://github.com/luminus-framework/luminus-template/commit/a21c7d6c94a78572ba6f9f1829a6ad2f77b36fec\r\n\r\nMaybe, at the very least, there should be sample dev and test config file so people can know what to put and have it in the docs to modify the filename. For a basic app, the information is benign: port, nrepl-port, and environment status. \r\n\r\nThanks for all the work so far!
