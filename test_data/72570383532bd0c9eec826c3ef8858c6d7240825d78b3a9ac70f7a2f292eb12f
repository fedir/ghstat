Basically, folks loading up projects with my library unexpectedly run into symbol conflicts with the `swank-trace-dialog` package. I happened to have a package named `std` that's worked great until recently. See hargettp/hh-web#5 & hargettp/hh-web#6.\n\nAny nickname defined in Slime basically means NO OTHER Lisp package should use those as package names or nicknames. Slime / Swank are key packages, but because of their role, they take up a lot of real estate.\n\nAre you sure its appropriate for Slime to use nicknames that could conflict with other Lisp packages? \n\nOf course, I can fix my package to use a different name...but this seemed like a key issue in Slime worth asking about.\n\nThanks for producing useful software, BTW! :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hargettp/hh-web/issues/5","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hargettp/hh-web","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hargettp/hh-web/issues/5/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hargettp/hh-web/issues/5/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hargettp/hh-web/issues/5/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hargettp/hh-web/issues/5","id":30484227,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMDQ4NDIyNw==","number":5,"title":"Hello world","user":{"login":"Davidbhodge","id":1624982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ5ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1624982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Davidbhodge","html_url":"https://github.com/Davidbhodge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Davidbhodge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Davidbhodge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Davidbhodge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Davidbhodge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Davidbhodge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Davidbhodge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Davidbhodge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Davidbhodge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Davidbhodge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7222520,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjIyNTIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hargettp/hh-web/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"hargettp","id":385400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/385400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp","html_url":"https://github.com/hargettp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"hargettp","id":385400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/385400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp","html_url":"https://github.com/hargettp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hargettp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":24,"created_at":"2014-03-31T04:08:56Z","updated_at":"2014-04-10T01:33:46Z","closed_at":"2014-04-10T01:33:46Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I have a reasonably new version of SBCL and Slime ( both from this year at least).\n\nLoading hh-web is ok.\n\nwinning Creating a sample project leads to a symbol conflict with SWANK. hh-web exports a symbol \"ID \", also exported by SWANK-TRACE-DIALOG.
