I won't hide it's just a tracing-paper of Vue's plugins you can find [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/plugins.html).\r\n\r\n## Use\r\n\r\nIn Vue this method is basically needed to extend Vue.prorotype conveniently and transparently with new properties and methods from 3rd party modules (called plugins). And also to control that the plugin will be applied only once. But I suggest making this method available also to instances of Ractive.\r\n\r\nIn my solution, plugin is just a function which called in context of caller with additional params:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/**\r\n * This callback fired when all waitings resolved.\r\n * @callback pluginCallback\r\n * @param {...(*)} args - Bunch of arguments\r\n * @this (Ractive|instance)\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Apply external function with args to Ractive's constructor or Ractive's instance\r\n *\r\n * @param {pluginCallback} plugin - Plugin function which will be exetuted in context of coller\r\n * @param {...(*)} args - Bunch of arguments\r\n */\r\nfunction use(plugin, ...args) {};\r\n\r\nRactive.prototype.use = use;\r\nRactive.use = use;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// ./plugins/myplugin.js\r\n\r\n// plugins files itself doesn't need to import Ractive or something. it's just a function.\r\nexport default function (options) {\r\n       this.newMethod = function() {\r\n              console.log(options.some);\r\n       };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```javascript\r\nimport Ractive from 'ractive';\r\nimport MyPlugin from './plugins/myplugin';\r\n\r\n// assign new method(s) or prop(s) to Ractive constructor\r\nRactive.use(MyPlugin, {some: 'option 1'});\r\n\r\n// next call of the same plugin will be ignored (do nothing)\r\nRactive.use(MyPlugin, {some: 'option 1'});\r\n\r\nRactive.newMethod(); // => 'option 1'\r\n\r\n// the same behaviour is for instances\r\nconst app = new Ractive({});\r\n\r\napp.use(MyPlugin, {some: 'option 2'});\r\n\r\napp.newMethod(); // => 'option 2'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this suggestion will be accepted, I can provide the pull request for these features. Actually, I already have that code as a separate module.\r\n\r\nExpect your comments, thanks!\r\n\r\n","score":1.0}]}
