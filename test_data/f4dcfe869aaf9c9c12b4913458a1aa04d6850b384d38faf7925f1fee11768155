Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents SHOULD display any included entity to the user.\n> \n> If the client is sending data, a server implementation using TCP SHOULD be careful to ensure that the client acknowledges receipt of the packet(s) containing the response, before the server closes the input connection. If the client continues sending data to the server after the close, the server's TCP stack will send a reset packet to the client, which may erase the client's unacknowledged input buffers before they can be read and interpreted by the HTTP application.\n\nNote that all caps SHOULD include and entity containing an explanation of the error.\n\nA good example of where this is needed and used effectively is card validation error codes with Stripe:\n\nhttps://stripe.com/docs/api/java#errors\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kohesive/kovert/issues/33","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kohesive/kovert","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kohesive/kovert/issues/33/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kohesive/kovert/issues/33/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kohesive/kovert/issues/33/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kohesive/kovert/issues/33","id":157018711,"number":33,"title":"Kovert isn't respecting defaulted query params","user":{"login":"adambrown","id":411773,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/411773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambrown","html_url":"https://github.com/adambrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambrown/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-26T15:59:18Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T19:18:54Z","closed_at":"2016-05-27T19:18:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"e.g.\n\n```\n/**\n *\n *  HTTP GET /path/thing/:thingid/subthing/subsubthings?size=50&forwardMarker=invoice_id\n *\n */\nfun Context.listThingByThingidSubthingSubsubthing(thingid: String, size: Int = 50, forwardMarker: String? = null): Promise<WithScrolling<String, List<Thing>>, Exception> {\n```\n\nmakes the rest client always provide size and forwardMarker params even though there are sensible defaults that could be used.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kohesive/kovert/issues/12","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kohesive/kovert","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kohesive/kovert/issues/12/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kohesive/kovert/issues/12/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kohesive/kovert/issues/12/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kohesive/kovert/issues/12","id":103754379,"number":12,"title":"Kotlin M13 support","user":{"login":"apatrida","id":182340,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/182340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida","html_url":"https://github.com/apatrida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":253828784,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kohesive/kovert/labels/Problem","name":"Problem","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-08-28T16:49:22Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T19:17:11Z","closed_at":"2016-05-27T19:17:11Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"It's coming, and we have reflection changes.
