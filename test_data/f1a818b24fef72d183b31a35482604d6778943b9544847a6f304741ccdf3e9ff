After downloading the pre-release and uploading everything to my webspace I was asked to use `composer install` first. So I let composer do its thing and after a while it was done giving only the following warnings:\r\n> Package kherge/version is abandoned, you should avoid using it. No replacement was suggested.\r\n> Package herrera-io/json is abandoned, you should avoid using it. Use kherge/json instead.\r\n> Package herrera-io/phar-update is abandoned, you should avoid using it. No replacement was suggested.\r\n\r\nI thought I'd be good and tried to access my new Pico installation but I only got a HTTP Error code 500.
