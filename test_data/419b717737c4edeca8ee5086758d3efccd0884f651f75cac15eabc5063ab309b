ifBlank with strlen again\"\n\nThis reverts commit ac72c832b9d037c837a244b318984a6e1f4abd50.\n\nThe patch for issue #84434 introduced a different behavior for the\nstdWrap.ifBlank feature. The current implementation now ignores\nwhitespace characters (tab, spaces, new lines, carriage return)\nwhich was not the case in previous TYPO3 versions - as a comparison:\n\n* TYPO3 v7: trim($content) === ''\n* TYPO3 v6.2: !strlen(trim($content))\n* TYPO3 v.4.5: !strlen(trim($content))\n* TYPO3 v4.3: !strlen(trim($content)\n\nThus, the trim() part is basically missing currently. To avoid this\nregression concerning the change of behavior, the change is reverted.\n\nRelated: #84434\nResolves: #84520\nReleases: master, 8.7\nChange-Id:
