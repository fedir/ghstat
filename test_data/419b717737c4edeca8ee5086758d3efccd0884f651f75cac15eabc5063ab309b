version placeholders in workspaces anymore\n\nCreating a new record in a workspace adds two database rows.\n\nOne that is the \"placeholder\", which - since v10.4 - contains\nthe same metadata as the other record:\n\n* t3ver_wsid = workspaceID\n* t3ver_oid = 0 (simulating behavior of an \"online pendant record\")\n* t3ver_state = 1\n\nAnd the \"versionized\" record, identified by:\n\n* t3ver_wsid = workspaceID\n* t3ver_oid = uid of the new placeholder record\n* t3ver_state = -1\n\nAs of TYPO3 v10, the first record is not needed anymore,\nthe versioned record can be queried directly, however, since\nthe relations (except MM) point to the placeholder record,\nthis one is kept.\n\nAs result, only one record is created from now on:\n\n* t3ver_wsid = workspaceID\n* t3ver_oid = 0 (no online counterpart)\n* t3ver_state = 1\n\nOn reading, the record is queried directly (no overlay needed anymore!)\nwith the existing Database Doctrine Restrictions. On publishing, the\nrecord just gets the state/stage/wsid set and is \"live\".\n\nThis brings fundamental benefits:\n\n* No overlays needed when querying\n* Fewer database records (placeholders are not helpful)\n* Conceptual problems with placeholder and shadowed fields are removed\n\nResolves: #92791\nReleases: master\nChange-Id: I0288cc63fe72d8442d586f309bd4054ac44e829b\nReviewed-on:

usage of contrib packages in TypeScript\n\nNo need to use a fully qualified namespace for\n3rd party modules that are placed in TYPO3/CMS/Core/Contrib.\nThere are usually aliases configured in the requirejs configuration,\nand if they are missing, we add them now.\n\nThis change additionally drops an unneded module declaration\nfor \"TYPO3/CMS/Core/Contrib/imagesloaded.pkgd.min\" which is\nnot needed when simply using \"imagesloaded\" as module name.\n\nCommands used:\n\n  grunt build\n\nReleases: master, 10.4\nResolves: #92725\nChange-Id:
