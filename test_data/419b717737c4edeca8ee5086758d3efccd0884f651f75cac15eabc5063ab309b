Introduce Site Handling\n\nTYPO3 is famously known for the \"multi-site\"\nfunctionality, allowing multiple websites running\nwithin one TYPO3 instance.\n\nHowever, configuring a multi-site had various downsides,\nmostly regarding to domain/entrypoint handling for a site,\nand if lots of languages were in place.\n\nConcepts like \"absRefPrefix\", \"baseURL\", various language\nrelated TypoScript settings, and the infamous\n\"L\" GET parameter can now be seen obsolete.\n\nAlso, handling page-not-found or access-denied errors\nhave never been easier, as every admin/integrator is able\nto configure this.\n\nWhat TYPO3 calls a \"site\" is a entrypoint / pagetree,\nand contains both configuration values relevant for\nBackend and Frontend.\n\nA site configuration has a unique (human-readable)\n\"site identifier\" and the following additional values:\n\n* Root page ID\nThis is a page on the root level (pid=0) or having\n\"is_siteroot\" checked.\n\n* The base path / base URL\nThis HTTP entry point e.g. https://www.mydomain.com/\n (\"Base URL\" / HTTP entry point,\nlike https://www.mydomain.com/)\n\n-- This allows to fully identify a pagetree with\nan entrypoint without having to guess during \"runtime\".\n\n* The definition of all available languages for this\n  pagetree, including the default language for this\n  specific pagetree.\n\n-- This includes both values for backend-related as\nwell as information, previously only settable via TypoScript.\n\nThis way, it is possible to have a TYPO3 installation\nwith 20 languages, but only using 5 languages within\none pagetree (site), using 15 different languages in\nanother site, while also giving meaning for all records\nwithin one site.\n\nA site configuration can be added or edited within the\nTYPO3 Backend in a new backend module for admins,\nand is then persisted in\n\"typo3conf/sites/site-identifier/config.yaml\".\n\nThe configuration format yaml is chosen as it minimizes\nthe risk of doing hacks, but the concept of a SiteConfiguration\ncan be adapted / exchanged to be overloaded or found\nin various other places in the future.\n\nAdding a site configuration for a project has various\nbenefits:\n- Configuration is in one place, stored in the file system\n  thus, is deployable.\n- Configuration can be done by an integrator/admin without\n  any programming skills => in one place.\n- The necessity to query sys_language is only needed when\n  configuring a site.\n- No need to configure TSconfig options like\n  \"previewDomains\" and \"defaultLanguageLabel\" are gone.\n  is\n- No need to configure any TypoScript conditions, or\n  even TypoScript settings related to language handling.\n- It is possible to configure error handling on a per-site\n  level, even language-dependant, without having to\n  code or configure anything.\n\nHowever, if no site is configured for a pagetree, the\nprevious behaviour is still in place, allowing to migrate\nslowly to the sites handling, as some key functionality like\nURL path handling for speaking URLs is not in place yet.\n\nIt is important to understand that adding a site\nconfiguration comes with various restrictions:\n- \"sys_domain\" handling is not necessary anymore, as a page\n  is resolved via the domain+base URL given in the configuration\n- Any previously configured TypoScript conditions based\n  on L parameter do not apply anymore if a site is configured\n- This also applies to any config.*language* related TypoScript\n  setting.\n- It is necessary to use a URI with scheme and path to configure\n  a site, where as previously, TYPO3 would work without a base\n  URL.\n- mod_rewrite or something similar is a requirement for sites\n  to work properly.\n\nFurther improvements not yet implemented:\n- Ensure backend modules like Web->Page, Web->View, Web->List\nand Web->Info only show records in the configured site languages.\n- Enable the possibility to handle \"domain entry aliases\",\n  also for multi-server setups with different domain names.\n- Ensure the new Site module can handle \"read-only\" / deployable\n  site configurations.\n- Allow to activate a language for a site to be editable\n  in the Backend but not be available in the Frontend for\n  everybody.\n- Handling \"Storage Folder\" on the top level with different\n  language entries.\n- Improve URL generation in frontend to skip sys_domain\n  resolving.\n- TypoScript conditions for [site = my-identifier] and\n  [siteLanguage = dk].\n- Improve proper caching for rootline resolving of pages\n  without restrictions.\n- Improve resolving of siteLanguage from the current request.\n- Linking from one site to a page of a different site.\n- Centralizing access to sys_language and sys_domain.\n- Handle copying/moving of records to a different site\n  with different languages and language settings.\n- Handle configuration change (like deleting a language\n  in the configuration - what should happen to the\n  translated records?)\n\nNext up for 9.3:\n- Adding \"Routers\" on top of sites for URL resolving\n  of pages and records.\n- Handle Storage Folders on top level rootline\n- Handle Mount Points\n\nNew API:\n- New Entity classes \"Site\" and \"SiteLanguage\" are\n  resolved as part of a PSR-15 middleware and available\n  for pages in FE and BE when possible.\n- A SiteFinder object is used to query Site and SiteLanguage\n  objects and used in various places.\n- The new PageUriBuilder allows to create links to pages\n  without any relation to the current request, and\n  are already in use in Frontend links and Backend preview links.\n- A PageErrorHandlerInterface allows to custom error handlers\n  to be introduced by extensions and configured on any site.\n\nSite handling is considered still \"under development\"\nuntil TYPO3 9 LTS, and implementation as well as the\nconfiguration format might change in the next sprint\nreleases, in order to gather feedback on what is missing\nin the implementation.\n\nAs a site configuration will be mandatory for TYPO3 v10.0,\nsome changes regarding sys_language and sys_domain will\nfollow.\n\nBeware:\n- Due to the definition of every record of default language\n  (language=0), it might be possible to switch to locales\n  for languages and get rid of the language ID.\n- sys_domain won't make it any much longer.\n\nResolves: #84581\nReleases: master\nChange-Id: Iabeeb6835a98c8f5a71d502379ed63a68dfad6dd\nReviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/56505\nTested-by: TYPO3com <no-reply@typo3.com>\nReviewed-by:
