The feature .rst file outlines\nfield details.\n\nGoals:\n* Save extension developers time.\n* Less copy+paste issues and different general fields definitions.\n* Reduce number of boilerplate fields in ext_tables.sql.\n* Bring schema of management fields under core control.\n\nNon goals:\n* No full substitution of ext_tables.sql by TCA: \"Business\"\n  fields from 'columns' are NOT created automatically. This\n  would require further thoughts and code disentangling.\n* No new extension API.\n* No \"migration\" approach or similar.\n\nNotable patch details:\n* The patch is a revamped version of issue #81234 that has been\n  abandoned. As requested in the review of #81234, the code now\n  hooks in after ext_tables.sql has been parsed into the doctrine\n  schema.\n* Field defintions of ext_tables.sql take precedence, auto fields\n  are only added if ext_tables.sql does not define a column or index.\n  This makes the patch fully backwards compatible.\n* No deprecation for obsolete field definitions in ext_tables.sql\n  is logged.\n* Many core fields are aligned to a central definition and slightly\n  change. For instance \"uid\" is now always an unsigned int.\n* Reduce all core's ext_tables.sql files as well as the functional\n  testing related ext_tables.sql files down to the business fields\n* A relatively huge series of test adaptions: Especially the\n  ext:impexp related functionals now create dumps with differently\n  sorted fields - This is no problem during import.\n* Field t3_origuid of sys_file_reference has never been registered\n  in TCA as ['ctrl']['origUid'], is thus unused and removed as obsolete.\n* The extension manager no longer applies possible destructive changes,\n  it only adds missing columns and tables when loading / updating\n  extensions. It however considers *all* ext_tables.sql files, not only\n  the one the extension in question provides. See the important .rst\n  file for details.\n\nChange-Id: I640a7c7da3b63bac21a71102f253aa2d1bef4391\nResolves: #85160\nRelated: #81234\nReleases: master\nReviewed-on:
