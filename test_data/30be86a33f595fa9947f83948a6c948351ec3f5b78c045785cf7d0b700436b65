I reproduced this error with both the current vspd master and an older vspd build from a couple weeks ago that I rolled back to. Despite running the same builds of vspd/dcrd/etc on mainnet, I was able to confirm from my nginx logs that vspd has never returned a 503 like this on mainnet.  So it kinda feels like I must have broken something on the testnet deployment, but the only difference I can think of is upgrading dcrd to rc2 from a slightly earlier build. \r\n\r\ntestnet ticketbuyer:\r\n```\r\n2020-11-11 10:26:24.758 [ERR] WLLT: vsp ticket 02151ce69dca5ea9815b3349e1f70dccc1066b6e03fc8d2112c63b9a33e4fbda fee proccessment failed: POST https://test.stakey.net/api/v3/feeaddress: http 503 Service Unavailable\r\n2020-11-11 10:26:24.795 [INF] TKBY: Purchased ticket 02151ce69dca5ea9815b3349e1f70dccc1066b6e03fc8d2112c63b9a33e4fbda at stake difficulty 80.92276861 DCR\r\n```\r\n\r\ntestnet vspd:\r\n```\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: 2020-11-11 18:26:25.368 [DBG] API: payFee: Fee tx received for ticket (minExpectedFee=0.00101031 DCR, feePaid=0.00101031 DCR, ticketHash=1e65e1be4f8e94227f021c108366e993d95b245212ef9471fdc3472b4722d684)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: 2020/11/11 18:26:25 [Recovery] 2020/11/11 - 18:26:25 panic recovered:\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: POST /api/v3/payfee HTTP/1.0\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: Host: 127.0.0.1:8800\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: Connection: close\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: Accept-Encoding: gzip\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: Connection: close\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: Content-Length: 722\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: Vsp-Client-Signature: IGmM2O26ooJhSPYJIItpR2BdjBzIB2XbycIbiRaBWLIhH8YKp5M1alTZBcH1ogF21y6grF9IKISgeeJxplJGI0E=\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: [1B blob data]\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /usr/lib/go/src/runtime/panic.go:212 (0x44d472)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /usr/lib/go/src/runtime/signal_unix.go:720 (0x44d2f2)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/pkg/mod/go.etcd.io/bbolt@v1.3.5/bucket.go:157 (0x64971a)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/pkg/mod/go.etcd.io/bbolt@v1.3.5/bucket.go:201 (0x649bcc)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/src/github.com/decred/vspd/database/votechange.go:40 (0x790b24)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/pkg/mod/go.etcd.io/bbolt@v1.3.5/db.go:694 (0x650c95)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/src/github.com/decred/vspd/database/votechange.go:31 (0x78ddef)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/src/github.com/decred/vspd/webapi/payfee.go:274 (0x9ddc64)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/pkg/mod/github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.6.3/context.go:161 (0x9b701a)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/pkg/mod/github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.6.3/logger.go:241 (0x9c9f44)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/pkg/mod/github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.6.3/context.go:161 (0x9b701a)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/pkg/mod/github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.6.3/recovery.go:83 (0x9cae44)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/pkg/mod/github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.6.3/context.go:161 (0x9b701a)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/pkg/mod/github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.6.3/gin.go:409 (0x9c1039)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /home/isuldor/go/pkg/mod/github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.6.3/gin.go:367 (0x9c072c)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /usr/lib/go/src/net/http/server.go:2843 (0x75c3c2)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /usr/lib/go/src/net/http/server.go:1925 (0x757acc)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: /usr/lib/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:1374 (0x46d8a0)\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]:\r\nNov 11 18:26:25 fra-test vspd[18027]: [GIN-debug] [WARNING] Headers were already written.

In this scenario, we noticed an application's code path in which the line number on the printed stacktrace is wrong, returning line 59 instead of line 61 (it took me a long time to realize that something was wrong with the stacktrace itself and not the reported line):\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (ls LocationsMutableService) getChildren(ctx context.Context, tree string, loc string) (LocationChildren, error) {\r\n\turl := \"\"\r\n\tvar children LocationChildren\r\n\r\n//line 59 - panic not possible here\r\n\tresponse, err := ls.Client.GET(url, &children)\r\n\r\n//line 61 - actual place of panic (response == nil)\r\n\tif response.StatusCode == http.StatusNotFound { \r\n\t\treturn nil, errors.New(\"\")\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn nil, err\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn children, err\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe fixed this by writing a implementation based on debug.Stack() but, surprisingly, after deploying the fix to verify it I'm observing that the internal stacktrace used by txn.NoticeError has the same inaccuracy that our original middleware implementation had:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019/08/30 14:33:09 /go/src/github.com/.../src/api/vendor/github.com/.../gingonic/mlhandlers/nr_stack.go 19 mlhandlers.GetStackTrace\r\n/go/src/github.com/.../src/api/vendor/github.com/.../gingonic/mlhandlers/recovery.go 58 mlhandlers.RecoveryWithWriter.func1.1\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/panic.go 522 runtime.gopanic\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/panic.go 82 runtime.panicmem\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/signal_unix.go 390 runtime.sigpanic\r\n/go/src/github.com/.../src/api/gateways/locations_mutable_service.go 59 gateways.LocationsMutableService.getChildren\r\n/go/src/github.com/.../src/api/gateways/locations_mutable_service.go 51 gateways.LocationsMutableService.GetChildren.func1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter some research the main culprit seems to be a wrong PC being used when retrieving the stack frames, but I'm still not certain about the concrete cause. I changed the stacktrace generator code that manually generated the frames via https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/pull/101 but I keep noticing the same issue, so I guess it boils down to a difference between how runtime.Stack and runtime.Callers manipulate the systemstack  \r\n\r\nThe scenario I've been showing is on a specific branch of a web app we use at work (thus being unable to share it here), and unfortunately I've been trying to create a local repro case  to no avail\r\n\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/axiaoxin-com/pink-lady/issues/63","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/axiaoxin-com/pink-lady","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/axiaoxin-com/pink-lady/issues/63/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/axiaoxin-com/pink-lady/issues/63/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/axiaoxin-com/pink-lady/issues/63/events","html_url":"https://github.com/axiaoxin-com/pink-lady/issues/63","id":683949303,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODM5NDkzMDM=","number":63,"title":"重构TODO","user":{"login":"axiaoxin","id":2876405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzY0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2876405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/axiaoxin","html_url":"https://github.com/axiaoxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axiaoxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axiaoxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axiaoxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axiaoxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axiaoxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axiaoxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axiaoxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axiaoxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axiaoxin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-08-22T07:30:02Z","updated_at":"2020-09-11T02:57:02Z","closed_at":"2020-09-11T02:57:02Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"~~从logging添加自定义的gin logger中间件~~\r\n~~默认recovery中间件学习~~\r\n~~添加（自定义、sentry）recovery中间件~~\r\n~~学习其他中间件：https://github.com/gin-gonic/contrib https://github.com/gin-contrib~~\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
