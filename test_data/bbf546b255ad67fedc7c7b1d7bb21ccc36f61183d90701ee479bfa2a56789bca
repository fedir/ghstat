Moving these to object oriented structures is difficult because even removing the static keyword from the method declaration creates a B/C break and one that's not the most friendly to work around.  Likewise, these static method calls cannot be mocked in testing environments meaning proper unit testing of objects calling those systems cannot be done, and in a lot of cases this mandates that a unit test class sets up mocks of various global services.\r\n\r\nOne way we can cope with this is by introducing something akin to Laravel's [Facade](https://github.com/illuminate/support/blob/master/Facades/Facade.php) class, which is in essence a fancy way of proxying static method calls to an object resolved from the DI container.  It would basically allow us to keep the existing classes with their static APIs in place (so the existing classes would have to remain as the Facade classes), but the actual code could be migrated to new PHP classes which are designed in an object oriented structure.  Additionally, Laravel's Facade class exposes some API making them configurable in a testing environment, which would allow these static calls to be configured to use a mock object versus the production code.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/20015","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/20015/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/20015/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/20015/events","html_url":"https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/20015","id":309468375,"number":20015,"title":"JS

A quick example would be for a store manager and a warehouse manager using a sales/inventory component.\r\n\r\nThe permissions I need would require a number of stores that the store manager can control and a warehouse manager manages the stock in each store. In the access levels I would provide this like\r\n\r\ncore.admin\r\ncore.admin.store\r\ncore.admin.warehouse\r\ncore.create.staff\r\ncore.delete.staff\r\ncore.edit.staff\r\ncore.create.stock\r\ncore.delete.stock\r\ncore.edit.stock\r\n\r\nHaving a huge list of access levels looks confusing on the permissions screen but is necessary to provide fine grade control in the admin views. Anyone without core.admin.warehouse would not see the warehouse side bar menu option and anyone without the core.admin.store would not see the stores side bar menu option.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is either being able to add multiple sections to the rules input in the form manifest so that each included section is listed with a fieldset title, or within a section between the actions is a simple <heading name=\"store\"> <heading name=\"warehouse\"> type field in the access.xml manifest. This will break up the sections just to make it easier on the admin to edit the different parts for ACL permissions.\r\n\r\nSo the access.xml might look something like\r\n```\r\n<action name=\"core.admin\">\r\n\r\n<heading name=\"stores\">\r\n<action name=\"core.admin.store\">\r\n<action name=\"core.create.staff\">\r\n<action name=\"core.delete.staff\">\r\n<action name=\"core.edit.staff\">\r\n\r\n<heading name=\"warehouse\">\r\n<action name=\"core.admin.warehouse\">\r\n<action name=\"core.create.stock\">\r\n<action name=\"core.delete.stock\">\r\n<action name=\"core.edit.stock\">\r\n```\r\nand the heading would simply be a \r\n```\r\n  <tr><th colspan=\"3\">Store</th></tr>\r\n```\r\nbetween the actions\r\n\r\nI think with the current code in form/fields/rules.php it might be a simple solution to add to the actions a new property and test for the property, or if the name property is missing it automatically becomes a heading/separator row.\r\n```\r\n<action label=\"Stores\" type=\"heading\">\r\n<action name=\"core.admin.store\">\r\n<action name=\"core.create.staff\">\r\n<action name=\"core.delete.staff\">\r\n<action name=\"core.edit.staff\">\r\n```\r\nand then the $actions as $action loop wouldn't need to be changed greatly","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/20004","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/20004/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/20004/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/20004/events","html_url":"https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/20004","id":309048347,"number":20004,"title":"Error: Call to undefined method Joomla\\CMS\\Document\\XmlDocument::addFavicon(): Couldn not find view [name, type, przedrostek]: article, xml, contentView.","user":{"login":"zyzak","id":17711321,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17711321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyzak","html_url":"https://github.com/zyzak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyzak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyzak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyzak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyzak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyzak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyzak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyzak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyzak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyzak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":138443932,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms/labels/No%20Code%20Attached%20Yet","name":"No Code Attached Yet","color":"ededed","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2018-03-27T16:44:54Z","updated_at":"2018-03-31T14:07:46Z","closed_at":"2018-03-30T12:54:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n\r\nIn google search console I have over 8000 indexed links for example \r\ndomainname.pl/index.xml \r\ndomainname.pl/ayuda.do\r\ndomainname.pl/careless/Zehy/br.cgi\r\nect...\r\n\r\nI do not know why google is indexing this stuppid URLs.\r\nI have RSFirewall and can not find anything dangerous by test.\r\n\r\nall of this stuppid links giving me error Error: Call to undefined method Joomla\\CMS\\Document\\XmlDocument::addFavicon(): Couldn not find view [name, type, przedrostek]: article, xml, contentView.\r\n\r\n### Expected result\r\n\r\nget error 404 ?\r\n\r\n### Actual result\r\nError: Call to undefined method Joomla\\CMS\\Document\\XmlDocument::addFavicon(): Couldn not find view [name, type, przedrostek]: article, xml, contentView.\r\n\r\n\r\n### System information (as much as possible)\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem operacyjny | Linux sm1.linuxpl.com 4.4.41-grsec #1 SMP Fri Jan 13 01:28:39 CET 2017 x86_64\r\n-- | --\r\nTyp bazy danych | mysql\r\nWersja bazy danych | 5.6.36\r\nMetoda porównywania znaków w bazie danych | utf8mb4_general_ci\r\nMetoda porównywania znaków przy połączeniu z bazą danych | utf8mb4_general_ci\r\nWersja PHP | 7.1.10\r\nSerwer WWW | Apache\r\nPHP działa na | cgi-fcgi\r\nWersja Joomla!
