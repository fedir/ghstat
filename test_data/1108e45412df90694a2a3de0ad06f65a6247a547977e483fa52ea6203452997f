have this issue.\r\n\r\n### Reproduce\r\nOn Project Fauxton, DB sizes were showing around 120mb-240mb in size, much beyond the limits of Android's asyncstorage ([has a limit of 6mb](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/3387#issuecomment-148042923)).\r\n<img width=\"1602\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-06-15 at 2 05 50 pm\"

{strict_window, true}]\r\n\r\n(for some reason that i have yet to figure out, the server is not running compactions of it's own, even with those limits set.)\r\n\r\nIn my React Native project, after connecting to the remote and prior to syncing my changes to my local copy I run the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.remoteDB.compact(function (err, result) {\r\n  if (err) { \r\n    return console.log('Error Compacting Remote DB: ' + JSON.stringify(err)); \r\n  } else { \r\n    console.log('Compacted Remote DB: ' + JSON.stringify(result)); \r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nIt returns the following result: \r\nCompacted Remote DB: {\"ok\":true}\r\n\r\nAfter which I print out the info of the local and remote dbs:\r\nLocal DB Info: {\"doc_count\":483,\"update_seq\":554,\"db_name\":\"localDB-family-burton-1521607461-85ad91a8-2cc2-11e8-a033-da60d26d4275-development\",\"auto_compaction\":true,\"adapter\":\"asyncstorage\"}\r\n\r\nRemote

specific action we are updating / creating 3 docs, and for EACH of them we see being performed on the network layer a:\r\n _revs_diff, _bulk_docs, 4 x _local (2 are CORS but sill), an one _changes call,\r\nSo for a simple operation there are **7 server calls** (so 21 for this action) which seems like a LOT since the docs are quite small.\r\nWhat worries me even more is that at some point we need to update a list of documents which if it's going to be multiplied by 7 and I don't even want to imagine the performance impact especially on mobile devices.\r\nI really hope that we're doing something wrong here, but I've read everything I could find.\r\nAlso we're awaiting these calls but I really don't understand how should that affect since sync is done independently (I would believe).\r\n\r\n### Info\r\n- Environment: Web and Cordova hybrid app\r\n- Platform: Chrome\r\n- Adapter: IndexedDB\r\n- Server:
