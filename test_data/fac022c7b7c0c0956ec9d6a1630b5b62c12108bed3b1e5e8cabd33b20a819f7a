my changes into trunk. This should give us a nice clean trunk to continue with. It's strongly recommended that you merge this version with your sandboxes -- I've added all the phpdoc fields and changed a lot.\n\nI've removed the author/licence information from some files -- such as app/app_controller.php and config/database.php -- as they are not our code and those files need to remain as clean as possible for people not to get lost in them.\n\nI've run the tests on this one, but the tests are not as extensive as they should be. If you want to get the test controller etc. check out the version in my sandbox. But we'll probably be moving to SimpleTest  soon anyway.\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.cakephp.org/repo/trunk/cake@114
