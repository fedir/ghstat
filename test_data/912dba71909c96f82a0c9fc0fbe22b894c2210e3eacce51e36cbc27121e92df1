Solution with `RouteContext` (#91) but in the form:\n\n```\npublic interface RouteContext {\n    getRequest(); // or request()\n    getResponse(); // or response()\n    next()\n}\n```\n\nThe idea is to keep `Request`, `Response` concepts and to add more helper merthods (for example getApplication() or getPippoSettings()). Also I think that it's good to move `getSession` method from request and to put this method in `RouteContext` for example. In this mode I can change the signature of `SessionFactory.getSession(Request, boolean)` to `getSession(RouteContext)`.\n\nI wrote in a previous comment:\n\n> This RouteContext object maybe is valuable in the future if we want to put some business (methods) - of course is not ok to add more parameters in handleRoute and in this scenario we must create this context object (bucket).\n\nMaybe it's that time :smile: \n1. Put on thread local (see `Application.get()`) other information like request (Request.get()) , response, session\n\nFirst solution is the Ninja way, it's simple to implement but RouteContext has to walk through the entire application as parameter. The second solution is the Wicket way, it's simple to implement, you can access these objects from anywhere in application but probably will be sensible in async mode (if you plan to do something).\n\nWhat is your opinion?

suppose this could be just a misunderstanding but I have a problem using the authenticity token with upload forms; I think the implementation of AuthenticityFilter needs to be changed.\n\nLooking at the documentation [here](http://www.ninjaframework.org/documentation/basic_concepts/filters.html) and [here](http://www.ninjaframework.org/documentation/html_templating/advanced_topics.html) I understand that the following steps are required in order to the **authenticity token for protection against CSRF-requests** to work properly:\n1. configure a route:\n   \n   ``` java\n   public class Routes implements ApplicationRoutes {\n   \n       @Override\n       public void init(Router router) {\n           router.GET().route(\"/upload\").with(UploadController.class, \"showForm\");\n           router.POST().route(\"/upload\").with(UploadController.class, \"store\");\n       }\n   \n   }\n   ```\n2. implement my upload controller\n   \n   ``` java\n   public class UploadController {\n   \n       @Inject\n       org.slf4j.Logger logger;\n   \n       public Result showForm()\n       {\n           return Results.html();\n       }\n   \n       @FilterWith({AuthenticityFilter.class})\n       public Result store(Context context) throws Exception {\n           // Make sure the context really is a multipart context...\n           if (context.isMultipart()) {\n   \n               // This is the iterator we can use to iterate over the\n               // contents of the request.\n               FileItemIterator fileItemIterator = context.getFileItemIterator();\n   \n               while (fileItemIterator.hasNext()) {\n                   FileItemStream item = fileItemIterator.next();\n                   if (item.isFormField()) {\n                       logger.debug(\"We don't care about form fields here\"):\n                   } else {\n                       File uploadsDir = new File(\"/tmp/uploads\");\n                       uploadsDir.mkdirs(); //just to make sure the folders exists\n                       File uploadedFile = new File(uploadsDir, 'test-file');\n                       long bytesWritter = Files.copy(item.openStream(), uploadedFile.toPath(), java.nio.file.StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);\n                       logger.debug(String.format(\"File [%s] uploaded to [%s]\", item.getFieldName(), uploadedFile.getPath());\n                   }\n               }\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n3. and finally add the authenticity token to my form\n   \n   ``` html\n   <form method=\"POST\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" target='${reverseRoute(\"controllers.UploadController\", \"store\")}'>\n       <@authenticityForm/>\n       <label>File upload\n           <input type=\"file\" id=\"upload\" name=\"upload\"/>\n       </label>\n       <button type=\"submit\" >Submit</button>\n   </form>\n   ```\n\nHowever every time I click submit, all I am getting a \"401 Unauthorized error\", so I decided to check the validation creating my own filter to check all sent parameters, that let me to discover that **context.getParameters()** returns an empty Map, however the authenticity token is present in the submitted form, and you can get it using a [FileItemIterator](http://www.ninjaframework.org/documentation/uploading_files.html) instance; here is the code of my custom filter:\n\n``` java\npackage http.filters;\n\nimport

You can add annotations and ask for Validation, but I'd like a mode where that's just the default and throw a BadRequestException in that case.  Ties nicely into making the param an Optional (idea below) if the parameter is truly optional.\r\n Support for java.util.Optional wrapped parameters. If a user doesn't supply a value today than the parameter is simply set to null. An optional would help make getting it or having a default more NPE-safe. A controller method should allow you to do something like `@Param(\"query\") Optional<String> query`. Then in your controller you could say \"query.orElse(\"default val\")\".\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninjaframework/ninja/issues/273","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninjaframework/ninja","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninjaframework/ninja/issues/273/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninjaframework/ninja/issues/273/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninjaframework/ninja/issues/273/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ninjaframework/ninja/issues/273","id":51937776,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MTkzNzc3Ng==","number":273,"title":"pom.xml
