Given that active\nsize is defined to be the number of bytes used in a view file it must be\nstrictly greater than or equal to zero as well as less than or equal to\nfile size. Thus the great hunt had begun!\n\nWhile I'd love more than anything to regail you, Dear Reader, with the\ntales, the joys, the highs, and yes, even the lows of this search, it\nturns out that I cannot. I must not. For there were none!\n\nTurns out this was a trivial bug where we were re-using the ExternalSize\ncalculation instead of applying `couch_btree:size/1` to all of the\nbtrees in the `#mrview` records. Simple bug comes with a correspondingly\nsimple fix.\n\nI also noticed that the info tests were broken and not being run so I\nspent a few minutes cleaning those up to make the various
