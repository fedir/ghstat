with FF 52.0.2, after doing some research this seems to be an issue for quite some time though.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Go to the TActiveLabel quickstart tutorial\r\n- Click the \"click me\" button\r\n- Label is changing to \"You clicked the button, didn't you?\"\r\n- Hit F5 key to reload the page\r\n- Label is reverted to initial state \"This is a label\"\r\n- Click the \"click me\" button again\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n- The F5 key should have fired a normal request rendering a new PRADO_PAGESTATE in the hidden field\r\n- After hitting the \"click me\" button again, the label should change to \"You clicked the button, didn't you?\" again\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n- The F5 key fired a normal request but keeping the old PRADO_PAGESTATE on client side from the last callback\r\n- After hitting the \"click me\" button again, the label does not change anymore\r\n\r\nThis behavior with TActiveLabel is just a demonstration (which comes from cc53959 since the viewstate value is identical to the new value if the pagestate is restored using F5 reload), but the problem is a global one with a quite big potential to cause side effects using callbacks in FF.\r\n\r\nEvery change to values in page-/viewstate during callback are kept and restored after a F5 reload in Firefox since it is restoring input fields where hidden ones belong to. Since PRADO is using a hidden field to pass the current state to following requests this may end up having an \"unstable\" state after using F5 to reload a page.\r\n\r\nAfter some testing I can make these assumptions:\r\n- only affects FF, IE/Edge and Chrome behave \"correctly\"\r\n- looking at the response, PRADO renders a new pagestate on hitting F5, but somehow FF ignores it; running `$('#PRADO_PAGESTATE').val()` returns the old pagestate\r\n- hitting enter in address bar or using CRTL+F5 to force a cache flush make it also work in FF\r\n- only affects AJAX requests, hitting F5 after a postback asks to send form data again; this is intended behavior\r\n\r\nI found some \"solutions\" digging the web, the best and easiest way is to add `autocomplete=\"off\"` to the hidden field which prevents FF to restore the old value ... I tested it and it works correctly in all major browsers - not sure if it is W3C complaint though. If applicable , the fix needs to be applied to the `renderHiddenFieldsInt()` method within `TClientScriptManager` in line 903 (and maybe line 899) adding a `autocomplete=\"off\"` to the hidden field.\r\n\r\nThoughts on this?","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pradosoft/prado/issues/641","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pradosoft/prado","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pradosoft/prado/issues/641/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pradosoft/prado/issues/641/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pradosoft/prado/issues/641/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/641","id":219284097,"number":641,"title":"Keep selected value on callback","user":{"login":"frkinta","id":20577647,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20577647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frkinta","html_url":"https://github.com/frkinta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frkinta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frkinta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frkinta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frkinta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frkinta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frkinta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frkinta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frkinta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frkinta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":30230686,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pradosoft/prado/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-04T15:11:14Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T07:45:40Z","closed_at":"2017-04-19T07:44:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the selected value of DropDownList is loose after callback even when the value remain in datasource.
