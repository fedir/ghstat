On both windows 7 and 10 x64 with Firefox Quantum and Edge. Only Chrome works\r\n\r\nTry this: press `ALT` + `w` keys. You should press `ALT`, then `w`. Don't release `ALT` and keep pressing and releasing `w`. Now, when you want to stop release `ALT` (usually you release `ALT` after releasing `w` or at the same time).\r\n\r\nIt's like doing `ALT` + `TAB` on windows.\r\n\r\nRight now nothing happens, but before upon releasing `ALT` I was able to capture the moment when `ALT` key was released.\r\n\r\nThe only way I can capture the release of `ALT` is if while pressing `w`, I release `ALT` first.\r\n\r\nHere is a fiddle to test: [https://jsfiddle.net/e4berr36/1/](https://jsfiddle.net/e4berr36/1/)","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3988","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3988/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3988/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3988/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3988","id":300151228,"number":3988,"title":"height() return 0 in IE11 or Edge for <td> elements in table ","user":{"login":"aiiak","id":14100012,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14100012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiiak","html_url":"https://github.com/aiiak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiiak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiiak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiiak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiiak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiiak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiiak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiiak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiiak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiiak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":144311358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"eb6420","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-02-26T08:46:43Z","updated_at":"2018-02-26T17:29:12Z","closed_at":"2018-02-26T17:28:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\nFeature Requests:\r\n  Please read https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Adding-new-features\r\n  Most features should start as plugins outside of jQuery.\r\n\r\nBug Reports:\r\n  Note that we only can fix bugs in the latest version of jQuery.\r\n  Briefly describe the issue you've encountered\r\n  *  What do you expect to happen?\r\n  *  What actually happens?\r\n  *  Which browsers are affected?\r\n  Provide a *minimal* test case, see https://webkit.org/test-case-reduction/\r\n  Use the latest shipping version of jQuery in your test case!\r\n  We prefer test cases on https://jsbin.com or https://jsfiddle.net\r\n\r\nFrequently Reported Issues:\r\n  * Selectors with '#' break: See https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2824\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description ###\r\njQuery version:

the scenario where we got aware of the following issue, is much too complex for a post here and moreover, it is company property. ;)\r\n\r\nSo here an in its extent highly reduced example where you can reproduce at least that jQuery's function position( ) returns different values for properties \"left\" and \"top\" from version 3.3.1 on:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n  \r\n    <!-- Inclusion of jQuery -->\r\n\t\r\n    <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n\t\r\n\t<!-- Compare the results in the alert box with those in any -->\r\n\t<!-- other jQuery version as 3.2.1, 2.2.4, 1.6.3 and so on. -->\r\n\t<!-- Here you find all hosted jQuery libraries at Google:\r\n\t<!--    https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/ -->\r\n\t\r\n<script>\r\n\t\r\n$( document ).ready ( function ( ) {\r\n\t\t\r\n\tvar id = $( '#row-2' );\r\n\talert( 'id.position( ).top: ' +\r\n\t       id.position( ).top + ' - id.position( ).left: ' +\r\n\t\t   id.position( ).left );\r\n\t\t\r\n} );\r\n\t\r\n</script>\r\n\t\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n    .tableCell { border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: #a05020; padding: 50px; }\r\n</style>\r\n\t\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n\t \r\n   <table>\r\n      <tr>\r\n         <td class=\"tableCell\">\r\n\t    Cell 1\r\n\t </td>\r\n       </tr>\r\n       <tr>\r\n          <td id=\"row-2\" class=\"tableCell\">\r\n             Cell 2\r\n          </td>\r\n       </tr>\t\t   \r\n   </table>\r\n\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith all tested jQuery versions except 3.3.1, you get the result:\r\n\r\n> id.position( ).top: 132 - id.position( ).left: 10\r\n\r\nExclusively with jQuery 3.3.1 you get:\r\n\r\n> id.position( ).top: 124 - id.position( ).left: 2\r\n\r\nDivergences are still much bigger in our business code, all values fall down to zero and no container lands any longer where it actually belongs to...\r\nCan you tell me if there is any CSS property / relation which plays a central role from jQuery version 3.3.1 on (although I cannot find any note on https://api.jquery.com/position/ ) or if it has to be seen & fixed as a bug in this version?\r\n\r\nbye,

to react to the removal of an Element.\r\nAlso we can not react to elements after they are added.\r\nHaving something like a lifecycle to DOM elements would be great\r\nMutation Observer could come in handy here maybe?\r\n\r\n### Example ###\r\n\r\nIn Javascript/TS I create a couple of elements like `$a = $(\"<div><span>Some Text</span></div>\")`\r\n\r\nAt some point they are are added to the DOM, now it would come in really handy if we could react to this so we can give our element some more properties that were impossible to assign before it was loaded into the DOM. For example we now can calculate elements width which we couldn't do right after the creation of the element in Javascript since it was not in the DOM yet.\r\n\r\nFurthermore it would be powerful I think to do the following:\r\n`$(\"#div1\").on(\"beforeUnload\", function)`\r\nThere are many use cases where this would come in handy.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this does / doesn't make sense.\r\nIf you think that would be great to have I would start building up a concept\r\n\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3980","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3980/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3980/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3980/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3980","id":297411321,"number":3980,"title":"SVG Data URI breaks with jQuery","user":{"login":"saschanaz","id":3396686,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3396686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschanaz","html_url":"https://github.com/saschanaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschanaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschanaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschanaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschanaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschanaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschanaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschanaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschanaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschanaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-02-15T11:23:24Z","updated_at":"2018-02-16T19:24:18Z","closed_at":"2018-02-16T19:24:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description ###\r\n\r\nThe following code breaks data URI on jQuery 3.3.1:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$(`<img alt=\"this is an svg\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,<svg%20xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;/>\" width=\"961\" height=\"315\">`)[0].src\r\n\r\n// URI breaks:\r\n// data:image/svg+xml,<svg%20xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg%20xmlns=\"http:>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nhttps://codepen.io/SaschaNaz/pen/eVGQWE","score":1.0}]}
