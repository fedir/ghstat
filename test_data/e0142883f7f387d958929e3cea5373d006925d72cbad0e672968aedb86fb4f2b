I ask mostly because typically the selector statement is the start of a chain:\r\n\r\nThis statement ends up being a no-op when an element with id=elementid doesn't exist (for whatever reason, document not ready, server didnt emit it, etc)\r\n```\r\n$(\"#elementid\").on(\"click\", function(e) { console.log(\"click!\"); });\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem is, that no-op is subtle, and difficult to log.  You can test for it first, but this breaks the chain\r\n```\r\nif($(\"#elementid\").length==0) {\r\n  console.log('didnt find #elementid');\r\n} else {\r\n  $(\"elementid\").on(\"click\", function(e) { console.log(\"click!\"); });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose you could extend jquery, but this particular implementation breaks the chain.\r\n```\r\njQuery.fn.exists = function () {\r\n    return this.length !== 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps switching the implementation allows for chaining, but now requires inserting \"exists\" into all jQuery code:\r\n```\r\njQuery.fn.exists = function () {\r\n   if(this.length == 0) console.warn(\"jQuery warning: selector '%s' found zero items.\", this.selector);\r\n   return this;\r\n}\r\n\r\n$(\"#elementid\").exists().on(\"click\", function(e) { console.log(\"click!\"); });\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing ###\r\n1. Start with an empty DOM, \r\n2. `var $result = jQuery(\".definitelyNoClassDefined\")`\r\n3. `assert.that($result.length.is(0))`\r\n3. check that console.log is invoked with \"jQuery warning: Selector '.definitelyNoClassDefined' returns zero items.\"\r\n\r\nI feel like this could easily be plugged into all patch releases since its not a breaking change.\r\n\r\nEDIT: this started with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49803687/can-jquery-generate-warning-when-a-selector-finds-nothing-when-chaining","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4036","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4036/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4036/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4036/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4036","id":313706510,"number":4036,"title":"SPA in jquery","user":{"login":"lakinmohapatra","id":11457501,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11457501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra","html_url":"https://github.com/lakinmohapatra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-12T12:31:39Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T10:20:16Z","closed_at":"2018-04-12T12:43:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can we expect a future version of jquery which will allow to develop single page apps using jquery syntax?\r\nThis will be helpful for lots of jquery developers. \r\n ","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4034","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4034/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4034/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4034/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4034","id":312008381,"number":4034,"title":"Memory leak in IE 11 (Screens loaded in iFrame)","user":{"login":"sandeepbyathagururajarao","id":6302551,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6302551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao","html_url":"https://github.com/sandeepbyathagururajarao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-04-06T14:58:04Z","updated_at":"2018-04-12T19:25:47Z","closed_at":"2018-04-12T19:25:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description ###\r\nWe are using JQuery v3.3.1 with migration script.\r\nAs per discussion with Microsoft support team.

to make a jquery object from a [template ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) one has to do \r\n\r\n     $(document.importNode($('template#productrow').prop('content'), true));\r\n\r\nThis way the template document-fragment is cloned, added to the document in detached state and the clone is returned and wrapped in a jquery instance.\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have a core function that implements this feature that does the 3 steps above with the given template selector.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$.fn.appendTemplate = function($selector, callback) {\r\n      if(!($selector instanceof jQuery)) {\r\n              $selector = $($selector);\r\n      }\r\n      var content = $selector.prop('content');\r\n      var $template = $(document.importNode(content, true));\r\n      if(typeof callback === 'function') {\r\n           callback($template);\r\n      }\r\n      this.append($template);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo you can do code like this, to append code from a template\r\n\r\n```\r\n$('#producttable thead').appendTemplate('template#productrow',function($content){\r\n    $content.find('td.record').text('foo');\r\n    $content.find('td:not(.record)').text('bar');\r\n});\r\n```\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/04fop28n/6/\r\n\r\nAnd the plugin I use

This has been the case in all the browsers.\r\n\r\nPlease help me fix this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3986","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3986/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3986/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3986/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3986","id":299838438,"number":3986,"title":"Don't fill jQuery.cssProps if mapping isn't needed","user":{"login":"dmethvin","id":157858,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/157858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin","html_url":"https://github.com/dmethvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dmethvin","id":157858,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/157858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin","html_url":"https://github.com/dmethvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dmethvin","id":157858,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/157858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin","html_url":"https://github.com/dmethvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmethvin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-02-23T20:21:19Z","updated_at":"2018-03-21T00:45:13Z","closed_at":"2018-03-21T00:45:13Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"While working on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/pull/291 the tests failed indicating that we are using `jQuery.cssProps` still in a [somewhat insidious way](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/4a2bcc27f9c3ee24b3effac0fbe1285d1ee23cc5/src/css.js#L66). Each time someone accesses a CSS property we're populating it with properties like `{ width: \"width\" }`. That makes it hard for Migrate to warn since just about anything can end up there through no fault of external code. For now I won't land this warning and leave https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues/283 open until we can change the logic to only populate `jQuery.cssProps` when it needs to actually change the property name.","score":1.0}]}
