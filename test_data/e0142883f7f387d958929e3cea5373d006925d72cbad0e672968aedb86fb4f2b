I ask mostly because typically the selector statement is the start of a chain:\r\n\r\nThis statement ends up being a no-op when an element with id=elementid doesn't exist (for whatever reason, document not ready, server didnt emit it, etc)\r\n```\r\n$(\"#elementid\").on(\"click\", function(e) { console.log(\"click!\"); });\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem is, that no-op is subtle, and difficult to log.  You can test for it first, but this breaks the chain\r\n```\r\nif($(\"#elementid\").length==0) {\r\n  console.log('didnt find #elementid');\r\n} else {\r\n  $(\"elementid\").on(\"click\", function(e) { console.log(\"click!\"); });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose you could extend jquery, but this particular implementation breaks the chain.\r\n```\r\njQuery.fn.exists = function () {\r\n    return this.length !== 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps switching the implementation allows for chaining, but now requires inserting \"exists\" into all jQuery code:\r\n```\r\njQuery.fn.exists = function () {\r\n   if(this.length == 0) console.warn(\"jQuery warning: selector '%s' found zero items.\", this.selector);\r\n   return this;\r\n}\r\n\r\n$(\"#elementid\").exists().on(\"click\", function(e) { console.log(\"click!\"); });\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing ###\r\n1. Start with an empty DOM, \r\n2. `var $result = jQuery(\".definitelyNoClassDefined\")`\r\n3. `assert.that($result.length.is(0))`\r\n3. check that console.log is invoked with \"jQuery warning: Selector '.definitelyNoClassDefined' returns zero items.\"\r\n\r\nI feel like this could easily be plugged into all patch releases since its not a breaking change.\r\n\r\nEDIT: this started with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49803687/can-jquery-generate-warning-when-a-selector-finds-nothing-when-chaining","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4036","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4036/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4036/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4036/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4036","id":313706510,"number":4036,"title":"SPA in jquery","user":{"login":"lakinmohapatra","id":11457501,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11457501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra","html_url":"https://github.com/lakinmohapatra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lakinmohapatra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-12T12:31:39Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T10:20:16Z","closed_at":"2018-04-12T12:43:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can we expect a future version of jquery which will allow to develop single page apps using jquery syntax?\r\nThis will be helpful for lots of jquery developers. \r\n ","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4034","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4034/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4034/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4034/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4034","id":312008381,"number":4034,"title":"Memory leak in IE 11 (Screens loaded in iFrame)","user":{"login":"sandeepbyathagururajarao","id":6302551,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6302551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao","html_url":"https://github.com/sandeepbyathagururajarao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeepbyathagururajarao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-04-06T14:58:04Z","updated_at":"2018-04-12T19:25:47Z","closed_at":"2018-04-12T19:25:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description ###\r\nWe are using JQuery v3.3.1 with migration script.\r\nAs per discussion with Microsoft support team.
