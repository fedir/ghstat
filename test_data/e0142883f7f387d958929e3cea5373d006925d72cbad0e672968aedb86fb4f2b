The buttons has two classes ``btn btn-primary`` (the ones provided by bootstrap).\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nWhen a button is clicked, the content changes once!.

to make a jquery object from a [template ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) one has to do \r\n\r\n     $(document.importNode($('template#productrow').prop('content'), true));\r\n\r\nThis way the template document-fragment is cloned, added to the document in detached state and the clone is returned and wrapped in a jquery instance.\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have a core function that implements this feature that does the 3 steps above with the given template selector.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$.fn.appendTemplate = function($selector, callback) {\r\n      if(!($selector instanceof jQuery)) {\r\n              $selector = $($selector);\r\n      }\r\n      var content = $selector.prop('content');\r\n      var

you can do code like this, to append code from a template\r\n\r\n```\r\n$('#producttable thead').appendTemplate('template#productrow',function($content){\r\n    $content.find('td.record').text('foo');\r\n    $content.find('td:not(.record)').text('bar');\r\n});\r\n```\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/04fop28n/6/\r\n\r\nAnd the plugin I use

the scenario where we got aware of the following issue, is much too complex for a post here and moreover, it is company property. ;)\r\n\r\nSo here an in its extent highly reduced example where you can reproduce at least that jQuery's function position( ) returns different values for properties \"left\" and \"top\" from version 3.3.1 on:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n  \r\n    <!-- Inclusion of jQuery -->\r\n\t\r\n    <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n\t\r\n\t<!-- Compare the results in the alert box with those in any -->\r\n\t<!-- other jQuery version as 3.2.1, 2.2.4, 1.6.3 and so on. -->\r\n\t<!-- Here you find all hosted jQuery libraries at Google:\r\n\t<!--    https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/ -->\r\n\t\r\n<script>\r\n\t\r\n$( document ).ready ( function ( ) {\r\n\t\t\r\n\tvar id = $( '#row-2' );\r\n\talert( 'id.position( ).top: ' +\r\n\t       id.position( ).top + ' - id.position( ).left: ' +\r\n\t\t   id.position( ).left );\r\n\t\t\r\n} );\r\n\t\r\n</script>\r\n\t\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n    .tableCell { border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: #a05020; padding: 50px; }\r\n</style>\r\n\t\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n\t \r\n   <table>\r\n      <tr>\r\n         <td class=\"tableCell\">\r\n\t    Cell 1\r\n\t </td>\r\n       </tr>\r\n       <tr>\r\n          <td id=\"row-2\" class=\"tableCell\">\r\n             Cell 2\r\n          </td>\r\n       </tr>\t\t   \r\n   </table>\r\n\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith all tested jQuery versions except 3.3.1, you get the result:\r\n\r\n> id.position( ).top: 132 - id.position( ).left: 10\r\n\r\nExclusively with jQuery 3.3.1 you get:\r\n\r\n> id.position( ).top: 124 - id.position( ).left: 2\r\n\r\nDivergences are still much bigger in our business code, all values fall down to zero and no container lands any longer where it actually belongs to...\r\nCan you tell me if there is any CSS property / relation which plays a central role from jQuery version 3.3.1 on (although I cannot find any note on https://api.jquery.com/position/ ) or if it has to be seen & fixed as a bug in this version?\r\n\r\nbye,

console.log('error');\r\n            }\r\n          });\r\n\r\nThis was encountered this when returning a 201 with an empty body from a REST API, which seems like a legitimate scenario. It appears that no body is treated as an error case since there is no JSON to process, given that the errorThrown is:\r\n\r\n        SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input\r\n            at parse (<anonymous>)\r\n            at Ut (jquery-3.3.1.min.js:2)\r\n            at k (jquery-3.3.1.min.js:2)\r\n            at XMLHttpRequest.<anonymous> (jquery-3.3.1.min.js:2)\r\n\r\nThis also occurs for XML, however perhaps the case should be that no root element is actually valid, and JSON/XML parsing should be held off in such a case.\r\n\r\n* Current workarounds are to return an empty object from the REST API so the success block is hit as expected, or to change the dataType expected to 'text' so no automatic parsing is done and manually handle for when a body is not empty (which if using this pattern, should only be in error situations, and thus handled in the error function).\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3970","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3970/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3970/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3970/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3970","id":295276723,"number":3970,"title":"`.change()` not working correctly on radio buttons","user":{"login":"leonixyz","id":4563795,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4563795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonixyz","html_url":"https://github.com/leonixyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonixyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonixyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonixyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonixyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonixyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonixyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonixyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonixyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonixyz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-02-07T20:13:19Z","updated_at":"2018-02-07T21:09:48Z","closed_at":"2018-02-07T21:09:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Listening for changes on radio buttons seems not fully working: I expect the event to be triggered also when the radio gets unchecked. \r\n\r\nThe event listener works pretty fine for checkboxes, where the user has to click to uncheck, but for some reason radio buttons works differently.\r\n\r\nIf the user selects a radio button A, and afterwards selects radio button B, part of the same group, the `change` event is not triggered for A.\r\n\r\nTry code below: I am never able to log \"myRadio1 has been unchecked\" in the console\r\n\r\nedit: tested on Firefox 59, Chrome 63, on Mac OS 10.13.3\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n    <title></title>\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"myRadio\" value=\"1\" id=\"myRadio1\" checked> Option 1<br>\r\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"myRadio\" value=\"2\" id=\"myRadio2\"> Option 2\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"1\" id=\"myCheckbox1\" checked> Option 1<br>\r\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"2\" id=\"myCheckbox2\"> Option 2\r\n    </div>\r\n    <script\r\n      src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js\"\r\n      integrity=\"sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=\"\r\n      crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n    <script>\r\n    \t$(function() {\r\n    \t\t$('#myRadio1, #myCheckbox1').change(function() {\r\n                    let who = $(this).prop('id');\r\n                    let checked = $(this).prop('checked') ?

we can use either `$('<div />', plainObject)` or `$(document.createElement('div')).attr(plainObject)` to create a new `<div>` with attributes set, but we cannot use `$(document.createElement('div'), plainObject)`, which I would expect to be a bit faster than either of the currently valid approaches.   Is there some reason the latter approach cannot be supported?  When I look at the code, I do not see a reason it could not be supported... it looks like it would be a minimal code size impact.  (But maybe I am missing something.)  Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n","score":1.0}]}
