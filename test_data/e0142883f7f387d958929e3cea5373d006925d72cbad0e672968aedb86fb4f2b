of all, thank you very much for this project and for your work!\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nA regression could have been introduced in this commit 3e3b09d and, as it is returning `documentContent` only for `<iframe>`, it is no longer possible to access the document content of an `<object>` with an svg provided in the `data` attribute.\r\n\r\nFor example this would stop working since version `3.2.0`:\r\n```html\r\n<object id=\"svg-object\" data=\"1x1.svg\"></object>\r\n```\r\n```js\r\nvar svgObject = $(\"#svg-object\")\r\n\r\nsvgObject.on(\"load\", function(){\r\n\tsvgObject.contents().find('svg');\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test link\r\n\r\nThe test to reproduce this bug would need a `svg` in the same domain, as it isn't possible to upload it to any of the platforms, I cannot provide a test link. However, I've prepared a PR with the fix and the test case provided in it is the following:\r\n```js\r\nQUnit.test( \"contents() for <object />\", function( assert ) {\r\n\tassert.expect( 2 );\r\n\r\n\tvar svgObject = jQuery( \"<object id='svg-object' data='\" + baseURL + \"1x1.svg'></object>\" );\r\n\tvar done = assert.async();\r\n\r\n\tsvgObject.on( \"load\", function() {\r\n\t\tvar contents = jQuery( \"#svg-object\" ).contents();\r\n\t\tassert.equal( contents.length, 1, \"Check object contents\" );\r\n\t\tassert.equal( contents.find( \"svg\" ).length, 1, \"Find svg within object\" );\r\n\t\tdone();\r\n\t} );\r\n\r\n\tjQuery( \"#qunit-fixture\" ).append( svgObject );\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4042","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4042/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4042/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4042/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4042","id":315411358,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTU0MTEzNTg=","number":4042,"title":"The callback function parameters changes position when [].map is called","user":{"login":"pfncfen","id":3774176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQxNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3774176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfncfen","html_url":"https://github.com/pfncfen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfncfen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfncfen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfncfen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfncfen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfncfen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfncfen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfncfen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfncfen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfncfen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-04-18T09:57:21Z","updated_at":"2018-04-19T01:42:57Z","closed_at":"2018-04-18T11:49:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\nFeature Requests:\r\n  Please read https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Adding-new-features\r\n  Most features should start as plugins outside of jQuery.\r\n\r\nBug Reports:\r\n  Note that we only can fix bugs in the latest version of jQuery.\r\n  Briefly describe the issue you've encountered\r\n  *  What do you expect to happen?\r\n  *  What actually happens?\r\n  *  Which browsers are affected?\r\n  Provide a *minimal* test case, see https://webkit.org/test-case-reduction/\r\n  Use the latest shipping version of jQuery in your test case!\r\n  We prefer test cases on https://jsbin.com or https://jsfiddle.net\r\n\r\nFrequently Reported Issues:\r\n  * Selectors with '#' break: See https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2824\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description ###\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3774176/38924448-8f309896-432f-11e8-875b-13d6ce26de33.png)\r\n\r\nIt may caused by \r\n`\tmap: function( callback ) {\r\n\t\treturn this.pushStack( jQuery.map(this, function( elem, i ) {\r\n\t\t\treturn callback.call( elem, i, elem );\r\n\t\t}));\r\n\t},`\r\nthe callback.call( elem, i, elem ) may be callback.call( elem, elem, i ) to make the map function act the same when called from different method.\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\n","score":1.0}]}
