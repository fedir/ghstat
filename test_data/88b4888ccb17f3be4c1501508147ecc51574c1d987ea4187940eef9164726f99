I saw that symlinks for static directory for an application is created if and only if the directory exists at when you install (or update) the application via the manager. \n\nThis let me think that important notice may be written somewhere like a notification centre. An icon might (on/off) could suggest the administrators that new notification are available to check. \n\nThe notifications (mostly errors) are already signalled by the mean of a \"floating popup\"  when the event occurs. There could be stored also in the notification centre for later review.\n\nHere is some ideas of what should/could be logged: \n- Errors - Warning\n- Application needing update (modified the metadata, added static repository)\n- Requests for unexisting pages (404, ...) \n- New versions of NOS (and if they can be fast-forward or needs major maintenance) ?\n- Other things ?\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/novius-os/novius-os/issues/17","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/novius-os/novius-os","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/novius-os/novius-os/issues/17/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/novius-os/novius-os/issues/17/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/novius-os/novius-os/issues/17/events","html_url":"https://github.com/novius-os/novius-os/issues/17","id":10609208,"number":17,"title":"Problem on application removal","user":{"login":"mvy","id":757993,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/757993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvy","html_url":"https://github.com/mvy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-02-04T14:01:24Z","updated_at":"2013-02-04T14:37:11Z","closed_at":"2013-02-04T14:37:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I created an application with the wizard.
