using websockets to send/receive json data.\nIt is divided into 2 parts.\n1. with an ioloop interval I am broadcasting a websocket message every second to all clients\n2. clients can send normal websocket requests handled in on_message function\n\nWhat works?\n\n-clients can receive the broadcasts sent via interval from the server without problems\n-clients can send normal websocket requests handeld by on_message but only as long as on_message never answers back with self:write_message\n\nWhat does not work?\n-as soon as the server sends data back to the client in on_message 
1fa6
via self:write_message, the server does no longer process incoming websocket requests from the client, but the outgoing broadcast via interval to the clients still works.\n\nCommenting out the interval broadcast resolves the problem, I can then send requests to the server and the server processes them and can answer back without problems. But I would like to use the broadcasts in the interval, too.\n\nQuestion: Is this a bug or a limitation? As the server is singlethreaded I don't see the problem or the difference between:\n\n-2 subsequent broadcasts done in the interval which work well \nand\n-one broadcast in the interval followed by the answer back to the client in on_message (or vice-versa, I don't know what order causes the problem), which surprisingly leads to non-processing of further incoming websocket requests coming from the client. on_message gets no longer triggered then, but in tcpdump on the server side and in the websocket sniffer browser plugin I see that the browser still sends websocket requests to the server when I click for example a button on the website.\n\nBut both (interval broadcast and answer in on_message) is in the end realized via self:write_message().\n\nHave you an idea what can be wrong? No errors on the browsers network/javascript console, no errors on server side ssh console.\n\nThank you!\n\nThomas\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/issues/254","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/issues/254/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/issues/254/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/issues/254/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kernelsauce/turbo/issues/254","id":140490556,"number":254,"title":"Question: How to unbind/release used ports?","user":{"login":"Thomas12","id":1595627,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1595627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thomas12","html_url":"https://github.com/Thomas12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thomas12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thomas12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thomas12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thomas12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thomas12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thomas12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thomas12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thomas12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thomas12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":197283021,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kernelsauce/turbo/labels/Question","name":"Question","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-13T14:38:43Z","updated_at":"2016-07-10T07:50:28Z","closed_at":"2016-07-10T07:50:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I try to program a restart feature with execvp, currently it fails as after I do a \n\nturbo.ioloop.instance():close()\n\nand try to restart turbolua within the same lua script and instance via execvp, I get a: \"Could not bind to address.
