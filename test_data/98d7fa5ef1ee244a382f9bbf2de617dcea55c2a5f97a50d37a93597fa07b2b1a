change to TYPO3CR, mostly regarding unit tests but also fixing a bunch of issues.\nCode:\n * Changed order of arguments in a few constructors to avoid problems with DI\n * Removed ItemManager, as we need to overhaul saving anyway\n * Naming, whitespace and documentation fixes\n * (StorageAccessInterface) Added a bunch of method declarations so we can get a mock object or this\n * (Item) Changed isSame to be closer to the specification, effectively fixing a bug\n * (Item) Fixed missing exception on getAncestor() for root node\n * (Node) Fixed a bug where adding a node would cause existing subnodes to be ignored\n * (Session) save() is now dead until freshly implemented\n * (StorageAccess_PDO) getRawRootNode() now has code\nTests:\n * Renamed, reorganized and fixed a lot of code, documentation and whitespace\n * Tests use mock objects for storage, session, repository where possible (speedup!)\n * BaseTest class is gone now\n * StorageAccessTest has been split into a base class and a PDO-specific test for now\n * (TYPO3CR.db) The sqlite database is copied from the fixtures folder for the actual test, thus it is not changed anymore during the tests.\n * (TYPO3CR.db) The database is now empty except for the table structure, as all tests needing data use mock objects.\nOriginal-Commit-Hash:
