is creating a second, undesired auth_tkt cookie, without a domain -- if the domain name contains a dot.\r\n\r\nI am using Pyramid 1.10.4, the latest.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfig.set_authentication_policy(\r\n    AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy(\r\n        secret,\r\n        callback=effective_principals,\r\n        wild_domain=False,\r\n        parent_domain=False,\r\n        secure=secure,\r\n        samesite=\"strict\",\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the above code that might indicate more than one domain.  Therefore I expect only one auth_cookie to be created, but in fact 2 cookies are sent, one of them without a domain.  This means 2 redundant cookies keep traveling up and down the wire, where only one is needed.\r\n\r\nDebugging this issue, I found the following:\r\n\r\nI edited /etc/hosts to add this line:\r\n\r\n\t127.0.0.1       local.host\r\n\r\n...because the issue only happens when the domain name contains a dot -- such as in production.\r\n\r\nTesting on http://local.host:6543/ I saw the extra auth_tkt cookie appear when I logged in.\r\n\r\nIn order to debug this, it is necessary to restart waitress.  I saw that the value of the variable \"domains\" is `[None, 'local.host']`, as you would expect from the code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/blob/1.10.4/src/pyramid/authentication.py#L919\r\n\r\nBut at the end, when profile.get_headers(value, **kw) was called with `kw == {'domains': [None, 'local.host']}`, it returned this:\r\n\r\n    [('Set-Cookie', 'auth_tkt=5cd21111c756ca02499eb331385ca6730e64d9f4fd21e05b55c39235b5bcb14d9e7d6987b2e7327e3e68315bf8665bd9e11c55af7cfacc6a9f25d33838e4d2d55f48f34a1!userid_type:int; Path=/; SameSite=strict'), ('Set-Cookie', 'auth_tkt=5cd21111c756ca02499eb331385ca6730e64d9f4fd21e05b55c39235b5bcb14d9e7d6987b2e7327e3e68315bf8665bd9e11c55af7cfacc6a9f25d33838e4d2d55f48f34a1!userid_type:int; Domain=local.host; Path=/; SameSite=strict')]\r\n\r\nThe above contains 2 cookies.

It is a variant of this old ticket - https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/691\n\nPyramid's design makes it rather hard to set cookies on a redirect:\n1. A HTTPFound exception must be returned by a view; it can not be raised (unless you specify the headers in the raise).  Raising the redirect exception will clear out existing the `request.response` objects (which the set_cookie was registered onto)\n2. If you return the exception, you then need to catch it in a `pyramid.events.NewResponse` event and translate the headers from the `event.request.response` to the `event.response`.  \n\nIt would be really great if there were a simpler way to register cookies to unconditionally set via the request object - sort of like how `request.add_finished_callback` works.\n\nA common use-case for this is a

looks like `pyramid_openapi3` attempts to set `custom_formatters` as a standard argument:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_openapi3/blob/master/pyramid_openapi3/__init__.py#L176\r\n\r\nHowever, this value is a _keyword argument_, and it's position was changed in `openapi-core==0.13.3`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/p1c2u/openapi-core/blob/master/openapi_core/validation/validators.py#L9\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n##### 1. Create a custom formatter\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom openapi_core.unmarshalling.schemas.formatters import Formatter\r\n\r\nclass TestCustomFormattersFormatter(Formatter):\r\n\r\n    def validate(self, name):\r\n        return name\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 2. Register the custom formatter\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyramid.config import Configurator\r\n\r\nfrom .formatters import TestCustomFormattersFormatter\r\n\r\n\r\ndef main(global_config, **app_settings):\r\n    config = Configurator(settings=app_settings)\r\n\r\n    # openapi\r\n    config.include(\"pyramid_openapi3\")\r\n    \r\n    config.pyramid_openapi3_spec('openapi.yaml')\r\n    config.pyramid_openapi3_add_formatter(\"test-formatter\", TestCustomFormattersFormatter())\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 3. Update your openapi spec to reference said formatter (largely redacted)\r\n\r\n```\r\npaths:\r\n  /example:\r\n    post:\r\n      tags:\r\n        - example\r\n      description: example POST\r\n      operationId: examplePOST\r\n      requestBody:\r\n        description: body\r\n        required: true\r\n        content:\r\n          application/json:\r\n            schema:\r\n              type: object\r\n              required:\r\n                - prop1\r\n              properties:\r\n                prop1:\r\n                  type: string\r\n                  format: test-formatter\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 4. Make a `POST` request to the above path and look for an error in the logs. Error will look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[InvalidSchemaValue(value={'prop1': 'test'}, type=<SchemaType.OBJECT: 'object'>, schema_errors=(<ValidationError: \"Format checker for 'test-formatter' format not

gunicorn maintainers,\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n* `python 3.6.1`\r\n* `pyramid==1.9.2`\r\n\r\nOn September 12th 2019, I refactored the way an internal [`pyramid`](https://trypyramid.com/) server was being deployed, replacing `waitress` with `gunicorn`, per this Stack Overflow suggestion:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/26872261/10491481\r\n\r\nAt the time the internal PR was made, the latest release of `gunicorn` was 19.9.0.\r\n\r\nI was asked to review the implementation again today, specifically to test out the change on our development and production `CentOS 6.5` servers. I decided to do this with a new `git clone` of our codebase.\r\n\r\nAt the time I made the PR, I did not specify a version of `gunicorn` in `setup.py`, thus when I ran `pip install` today, it (unexpectedly) downloaded and installed `gunicorn==20.0.0`.\r\n\r\nIt was not clear why my settings in `development.ini` under `[server:main]` were not being reflected on start up.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, with the following settings in our `development.ini`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n[server:main]\r\nuse = egg:gunicorn#main\r\nhost = 0.0.0.0\r\nport = 9090\r\nworkers = 1\r\nworker_class = gevent\r\ncertfile=/etc/ssl/certs/current/webserver.cer\r\nkeyfile=/etc/ssl/certs/current/private.key.u\r\nca_certs=/etc/ssl/certs/current/intermediate.cert\r\n```\r\n\r\n`gunicorn 19.9.0`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ gunicorn --version\r\ngunicorn (version 19.9.0)\r\n$ gunicorn --paste development.ini \r\n[2019-11-12 12:42:59 -0800] [16733] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0\r\n[2019-11-12 12:42:59 -0800] [16733] [INFO] Listening at: https://0.0.0.0:9090 (16733)\r\n[2019-11-12 12:42:59 -0800] [16733] [INFO] Using worker: gevent\r\n[2019-11-12 12:42:59 -0800] [16744] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 16744\r\n```\r\n\r\n`gunicorn 20.0.0`\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ gunicorn --version\r\ngunicorn (version 20.0.0)\r\n$ gunicorn --paste development.ini \r\n[2019-11-12 12:45:28 -0800] [17295]

sync\r\n[2019-11-12 12:45:28 -0800] [17300] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 17300\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf note between the two outputs:\r\n\r\n* No longer deploying with SSL (Note how the output for `gunicorn 20.0.0` is `http`)\r\n* `host` argument no longer correct (Using the default `127.0.0.1` rather than `0.0.0.0`)\r\n* `port` argument no longer correct (Using the default `8000` rather than `9090`)\r\n\r\nI looked through the changelog for `gunicorn 20.0.0`:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/news.html\r\n\r\nBut there does not appear to be any mention of any intentional breaking changes to the `--paste` argument.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, if I pass what arguments I can in the command line with `gunicorn 20.0.0`, the server will start up as intended:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ gunicorn \\\r\n  --paste development.ini \\\r\n  -b 0.0.0.0:9090\r\n  --workers 1 \\\r\n  --certfile /etc/ssl/certs/current/webserver.cer \\\r\n  --keyfile /etc/ssl/certs/current/private.key.u\r\n[2019-11-12 12:54:08 -0800] [18979] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.0.0\r\n[2019-11-12 12:54:08 -0800] [18979] [INFO] Listening at: https://0.0.0.0:9090

would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there's more details I can provide about my environment to make this reproducible.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCorrey","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7277","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7277/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7277/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7277/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7277","id":626903031,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MjY5MDMwMzE=","number":7277,"title":"Pytest

all,\r\n\r\nI am a maintainer for Pyramid the web framework and we've got some funky tests doing some funky things... but all was well and I got things running on Pytest 5.4.1, however a change made between 5.4.1 and the now new 5.4.2 has somehow flipped things back to how they were before I switched the project to pytest.\r\n\r\nIn 5.4.1 I had to make this change to get our tests to pass:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/commit/72eca2f8e82f1af20e433218719d99e7627d5650\r\n\r\nBasically it seemed like it was dropping a bunch of information about the module it was actually in, and placing things under the `_pytest` or changing the function to no longer be a a method of a class.\r\n\r\nIn 5.4.2 that flipped back, and thus I reverted that commit.\r\n\r\nHowever I want to make sure that this doesn't become a game of me reverting a revert to only revert the revert again ;-).\r\n\r\nIs there a new test that was introduced that makes sure pytest doesn't regress on this? I couldn't find info in the release notes on what changed to cause this behavior to flip back!\r\n\r\nAny help or assuaging of my (probably unfounded) fears of having to play flip the commit would be
