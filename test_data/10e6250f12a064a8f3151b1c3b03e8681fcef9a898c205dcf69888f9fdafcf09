Mentioned this earlier in https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/pull/3243\n- `max`: `NaN` including `undefined` is considered the lowest item in the array. **Even lower then no item**\n\n``` javascript\n_.max([{a: {}}], 'a'); // => -Infinity\n```\n- `min`: same as max but `NaN` values are considered the highest items\n- `sortBy`: special cases all `undefined` values to the end of the array. All `NaN` values are moved to the front of the array\n- `sortedIndex`: **different from `sortBy`** (see https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/b07337f7a23a6607021981ab6ccdfdbff9e329e5#commitcomment-7164123): computed `NaN` is moved to the end of the list instead of the front\n\n``` javascript\nvar array = [{a: NaN}, {a: NaN}, {a: {}}, {a: 1}, {a: 2}];\n_.sortedIndex(array, {a: 3}, 'a'); // => 0\nvar sorted = _.sortBy(array.concat({a: 3}), 'a');\n_.findIndex(sorted, {a: 3}); // => 5\n```\n\n---\n\nI propose a `baseComparator(a, b)` used by those 4 functions (special case min?) which handles these cases consistently.

I think they should be considered `NaN < -Infinity < x`.\n\n``` javascript\n// Reasoning\n_.sortBy([{a: 1}, {a: -Infinity}, {a: 2}, {}], 'a')\n// Should => [{}, {a: -Infinity}, {a: 1}, {a: 2}]\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/farmOS/farmOS/issues/219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/farmOS/farmOS","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/farmOS/farmOS/issues/219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/farmOS/farmOS/issues/219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/farmOS/farmOS/issues/219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS/issues/219","id":534349418,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MzQzNDk0MTg=","number":219,"title":"Installation Via Composer","user":{"login":"generalredneck","id":526491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/526491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalredneck","html_url":"https://github.com/generalredneck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalredneck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalredneck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalredneck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalredneck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalredneck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalredneck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalredneck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalredneck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalredneck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-12-07T03:56:33Z","updated_at":"2020-03-20T01:25:03Z","closed_at":"2020-03-20T01:23:35Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I do a lot of work using composer and typically find it easier even to do Drupal 7 work this way in combination with the composer_autoload and xautoload modules. That isn't particularly the case here. Distributions in D7 don't package quite right when deploying via dist method, though they usually work just fine if you --prefer-source, so I'm explaining the process here in case someone else is trying to do the same.\r\n\r\nFirst, for the current version, I had to update the composer.json associated with the package. If this is committed to d.o everyone should be able to get most of the right dependencies. See https://github.com/generalredneck/farmOS/blob/1.2.6/composer.json.\r\n\r\nI added this composer.json to a fork of farmOs and then had my project composer.json point to it. Keep in mind, my version shows 1.2.6 because that's what I tagged the current change as. Some finagling may be needed if this is actually ever committed to drupal.org.. so I recommend a clone with tagged versions with everything beyond the `7.x-` as a mirror.\r\n\r\nI had to create custom packages for the libraries because the dependencies generaged by https://asset-packagist.org/ could not resolve to dependencies that worked with one another.\r\n\r\nThis is the final result and is

In this thread i would like to discuss the necessity of the opposite: extending the notation to indicate fundamental changes. \n\nI think that the main reason why developers are so reluctant to adopt SemVer is due to the fact that most of them use the major number to indicate project _generation_. They only change the generation version when there are **ideological changes, very significant improvements or a major rewrite** of the project.\n\nAnd with SemVer they see the major version escalate really quickly, which makes no sense to them. \"A slightest change in order of args of an API function that nobody uses -- and i'm ought to release version 2 of my project? That's boolshit! I'm not going to bump my project's version in next couple of years -- because it's not going to have any fundamental changes or updates.\"\n\nThere are a lot of large projects that don't follow SemVer, and i think exactly for the reason outlined above. I can name Sass -- a preprocessor used by dozens thousands web developers.\n\nThe only workaround of this problem that is compatible with SemVer's three-number notation and that i can think of is embedding the generation number into project name, e. g.  `Foobar2 v.8.3.12`. Some package managers do that already, e. g. Ubuntu has `apache2` package.\n\nBut currently in our `Gemfile`, `package.json`, `bower.json` files we have to remember which dependencies follow Semver `major.minor.patch` and which follow the traditional `generation.major.minor`. This is a tedious thing to take care of, and we see `bundle update` breaking our projects much more often than it should. The struggle is real!\n\nI think that introduction of the fourth number into SemVer notation will resolve this problem. This number could be arbitrary, e. g. `Foobar 3.2.1` indicates major version 3 of the first generation of Foobar, and `Foobar 2.3.2.1` indicates major version 3 of the second generation of Foobar.\n\nThis feature will allow most developers follow SemVer without escalating their project version (generation number).\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2071","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2071/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2071/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2071/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2071","id":9690670,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5NjkwNjcw","number":2071,"title":"Potential security thing for hashes","user":{"login":"nwertzberger","id":360347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/360347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwertzberger","html_url":"https://github.com/nwertzberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwertzberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwertzberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwertzberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwertzberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwertzberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwertzberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwertzberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwertzberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwertzberger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":52169,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MjE2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true,"description":null},{"id":52168,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MjE2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2013-01-04T18:44:41Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T08:49:31Z","closed_at":"2013-01-14T00:05:02Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"in the code for routes, a raw string is passed to _updateHash on line 1242, which can cause security issues according to certain automated scanners.

Цель\r\nОбеспечить корректное формирование размеров прямоугольников `Классов`, `Комментариев`,  `N-арной ассоциации` \r\n\r\n### Функциональные требования\r\n\r\n####  Корректное формирование размеров прямоугольников Классов,\r\n\r\nЗадача в настоящий момент частично решена слудующим образом.\r\n\r\nПри [формировании переменной input](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-designer/blob/a3fde20567f2ca5e2f3101e623ad41a80c243664/addon/objects/uml-primitives/fd-uml-class.js#L371) в методе updateRectangles() [родительский элемент DIV](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-designer/blob/a3fde20567f2ca5e2f3101e623ad41a80c243664/addon/objects/uml-primitives/fd-uml-class.js#L207) содержащий  HTML-элементы `TEXTAREA` в версии JointJS > 3.0.0 включается как дочерний элемент BODY. \r\nВ версии JointJS 2.2   родительский элемент `DIV` включается как дочерний элемент элемента `DIV` с классом `joint-paper`, входящего в элемент `DIV` с классом `ui form`. \r\nВследствии этого [стили для элемента TEXTAREA](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-designer/blob/feature-412-JointJS-3.0.1/addon/styles/components/fd-uml-diagram.less#L45) не применяются и размеры определяются некорректно.  \r\nДля решения проблемы в код `addon/objects/uml-primitives/fd-uml-class.js`  были добавлены [операторы, обеспечивающие вставку или перенос](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-designer/commit/e9042d88b56ee528553f27025e382b59a4456136) родительского элемента элементов TEXTAREA в элемент класса  `joint-paper`.\r\n\r\n#### Корректное формирование размеров прямоугольников Комментариев (Note)\r\n\r\nПроблема заключается в том, что после корректного определения размеров прямоугольника в `joint.shapes.flexberry.uml.NoteView`  [установка размеров прямоугольника](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-designer/blob/a3fde20567f2ca5e2f3101e623ad41a80c243664/addon/objects/uml-primitives/fd-uml-note.js#L94) не происходит. Параметры `width`, `height` SVG-элемента rect прямоуголника `примечания` не устанавливаются.\r\n\r\nСудя по всему это связано с изменениями в коде `JointJS > 3.0` и несрабатыванием триггера в [исходном коде backbone](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js). \r\n\r\n#### Корректное формирование размеров прямоугольников  N-арной ассоциации \r\n\r\nВозможно проблема вызвана теми же причинами.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Требования к реализации\r\n\r\nРазобраться в механизме формирования параметров `width`, `height` в SVG-элементе rect Примечания\r\n\r\nВозможно имеет смысл дублировать код  [обеспечивающий вставку или перенос](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-designer/commit/e9042d88b56ee528553f27025e382b59a4456136) родительского элемента элементов TEXTAREA в элемент класса  `joint-paper` в файл [addon/objects/uml-primitives/fd-uml-baseobject.js](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-designer/blob/a3fde20567f2ca5e2f3101e623ad41a80c243664/addon/objects/uml-primitives/fd-uml-baseobject.js)\r\nи в другие файлы описывающие классы не наследуемые от класса baseobject.\r\n\r\nВозможно проблема решится изменением алгоритма вызова методов `updatRectangles()` и/или `joint.shapes.flexberry.uml...View`.\r\n\r\n### Исходный код\r\n\r\n**Ветка feature-412-JointJS-3.0.1 проекта

The object is to reveal all the safe squares without stepping on a mine. The game became famous when Microsoft included it with Windows 3.1 but its origins go even further back.\n\nThis weekend's lab is to build a front end interface to Minesweeper against a backend API. The API will handle all of the game logic for you.\n\nThe API documentation is available at https://minesweeper-api.herokuapp.com\n\nThe API endpoints will be at that domain as well, i.e., `https://minesweeper-api.herokuapp.com/game`. I will have that live for you later tonight!\n\n### Deliverables\n\n* [ ] A publicly visible website on `gh-pages`, etc.\n* [ ] A repository on GitHub with your app's source code\n\n### Explorer Mode\n\n* Have at least two screens:\n  * [ ] The player chooses the difficulty to start a new game\n  * [ ] A game board, consisting of a grid of squares.\n* [ ] Players should be able to click to reveal a given cell (this will map the `check` action of the Game API).\n* [ ] Players should be able to double click to flag a given cell (this will map the `flag` action of the Game API).\n* [ ] The board should re-render it self based on the array of data the API actions respond with.\n  * [ ] The numbers of mines remaining should be included in this update.\n* [ ] Include a timer that counts up from 0 while the player is playing.\n* [ ] Players should not be able to \"check\" a flagged cell.\n* [ ] Your game should look great!\n\n### Adventure Mode\n\nThe design of clicking and double clicking to reveal and flag squares is risky, it's too easy for players to misclick and reveal a bomb they meant to flagg! Unfortunately the DOM doesn't have an event for \"right click\".\n\nYour task for Adventure Mode is to make the game work like the Windows game and allow you to right click on a cell to place a flag.
