am using [sentry](https://sentry.io) for monitoring errors and have a small revel application. I want to catch internal errors (templates failing to render, 5xx responses) and forward them to sentry. Where do I plug that into revel? I looked into Filters but I can only extract a `ErrorResult` there (only giving me a message, i.e. for 404s). It looks like even failed templates always return a `*revel.RenderTemplateResult` and give no indication of an error.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can point me to the right direction here in how to properly extract errors. My last resort will probably using a completely custom logger, but I don't want to log _everything_ into sentry either.\r\nIs there something I can already use or any sort of best practice for this?
