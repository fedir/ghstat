I've traced it down to the following. Recently, cowboy2 added a backpressure mechanism for streaming content: https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1376\r\n\r\nThis new mechanism sends `ack` messages back to the caller process in order to provide the backpressure. As noted in the comments here (added as part of https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy/commit/eaa052616f7c85d4daf4817ceecd5f87fecfc8f4) , it is no longer possible to send streaming data to cowboy2's handler from multiple processes:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ninenines/cowboy/blob/master/src/cowboy_stream_h.erl#L223\r\n\r\nHowever, when we have a simple HTTP controller in phoenix which streams data it appears that it (unsurprisingly) sends to the same HTTP/2 cowboy handler from multiple request handle PIDs when requests come in concurrently through the same HTTP/2 transport. This breaks the contract, and is resulting in the backpressure mechanism hanging when enough data is pushed at once.\r\n\r\nThe temporary workaround (which may still fail I think) is to increase the new buffer size to a sufficient amount so all data is ack'ed immediately. I'm not sure how to resolve this properly, it seems like the cowboy plug would need to start multiplexing streamed data somehow through a new process :grimacing: ","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1458","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninenines/cowboy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1458/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1458/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1458/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1458","id":638217382,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MzgyMTczODI=","number":1458,"title":"accepting connections with proxy protocol enabled","user":{"login":"sh3d2","id":1262719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjI3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1262719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh3d2","html_url":"https://github.com/sh3d2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh3d2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh3d2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh3d2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh3d2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh3d2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh3d2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh3d2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh3d2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh3d2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-06-13T19:26:42Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T18:48:57Z","closed_at":"2020-07-22T18:48:57Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy/blob/de955079f90d52cc626baebb52154f116c1ab5dd/src/cowboy_clear.erl#L38\r\n\r\ni bumped into a case when proxy protocol is enabled in options, but incoming connection has no proxy protocol information ex. connection wasnt made via balancer (haproxy) but directly.\r\nin that case im unable to accept that kind of connection.\r\n\r\ntl;dr im unable to accept a valid connection when proxy protocol setting is enabled. \r\n\r\nAre you considering a fallback to make it possible to accept that kind of connection? \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1460","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninenines/cowboy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1460/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1460/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1460/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1460","id":649213872,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDkyMTM4NzI=","number":1460,"title":"Streaming from multiple requests on HTTP/2 simultaneously may cause blocking","user":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-07-01T18:51:29Z","updated_at":"2020-07-03T09:09:39Z","closed_at":"2020-07-03T09:09:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"This was originally reported here: https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug_cowboy/issues/44\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, it seems the described scenario can happen when an alarm is sent but the connection was already blocked.

This way you don't need to keep a separate field only for the PID. :)\r\n\r\nThis seems to affect Cowboy versions 2.7.0 and 2.8.0.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and for Cowboy!","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elixir-plug/plug_cowboy/issues/38","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elixir-plug/plug_cowboy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elixir-plug/plug_cowboy/issues/38/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elixir-plug/plug_cowboy/issues/38/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elixir-plug/plug_cowboy/issues/38/events","html_url":"https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug_cowboy/issues/38","id":628768881,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2Mjg3Njg4ODE=","number":38,"title":"Telemetry events based on cowboy_metrics_h","user":{"login":"binaryseed","id":39946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/39946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binaryseed","html_url":"https://github.com/binaryseed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binaryseed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binaryseed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binaryseed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binaryseed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binaryseed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binaryseed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binaryseed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binaryseed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binaryseed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2020-06-01T22:29:22Z","updated_at":"2020-06-19T23:22:06Z","closed_at":"2020-06-19T23:22:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Continuing discussion from https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/pull/3869...\r\n\r\nCurrent plug telemetry handlers for `:stop` and `:exception` are susceptible to being terminated _during_ their execution because the cowboy process can exit at any time after the request is complete.\r\n\r\nThis may be avoided by leveraging the built-in handler system of cowboy, especially `cowboy_metrics_h` which provides a way to execute a callback at the _end_ of each request with stats about its execution.\r\n\r\nWiring up the additional handler is trivial, the thing to figure out is what data from it to expose, and what to name the telemetry event...\r\n\r\nhttps://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.8/manual/cowboy_metrics_h/\r\n\r\n* Should we all the data directly or transform it so we aren't exposing raw cowboy data structures?\r\n\r\n* Is `[:plug_cowboy, :metrics]` a reasonable name since it's providing summarized metrics (ie: not start and stop for spans)?

This happens when the process which reports the error to Sentry is killed.\r\nWhen the code [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-elixir/blob/dfcbf2349cd839f29b55cf231ba63e7cdef08655/lib/sentry/phoenix_endpoint.ex#L34) executes, the response has already been sent to the client. This means that the client may close the connection. If client closes the connection, the process which handles the request (and reports errors to Sentry) is shut down.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n \r\nErrors are always reported to Sentry, regardless of how much time it takes to report them\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nErrors are not sent to Sentry if they are not processed quickly enough\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI have created a simple PoC.\r\n\r\nFirst, I modified Sentry library to make it slower. This change can be found here https://github.com/aronglia/sentry-elixir/commit/290596596cb05e4d6fe739d2a0d6d9cdf266fa4c\r\n\r\nPoC which uses Sentry with that change can be found here https://github.com/aronglia/sentry-bug\r\n\r\n1. Run PoC with `mix phx.server`\r\n2. Make a request with\r\n```curl http://localhost:4000```\r\nObserve that the loop execution stops at random time and the code which should report error to Sentry is not reached.\r\n3. Make a request with\r\n```\r\ncurl -H 'Connection: keep-alive' http://localhost:4000 http://localhost:4000/x\r\n```\r\nObserve that the execution of the loop does not stop since the client does not close the connection.\r\n\r\nSimilar issue

Working for some time with Yaws, I was curious about Cowboy. I managed to build a container based on your Dockerfile and create certs. \r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker@boot2docker:/c/kklepper/test/cowboy$ docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp -v /www:/www -p 8012:8080 --name cb  kklepper/cowboy:alpine\r\nNo cookie is set or found. This limits the scripts functionality, installing, upgrading, rpc and getting a list of versions will not work.\r\nExec: /dockerwatch/erts-10.6.4/bin/erlexec -noshell -noinput +Bd -boot /dockerwatch/releases/1.0.0/dockerwatch -mode embedded -boot_var ERTS_LIB_DIR /dockerwatch/lib -config /dockerwatch/releases/1.0.0/sys.config -args_file /dockerwatch/releases/1.0.0/vm.args -- foreground\r\nRoot: /dockerwatch\r\n/dockerwatch\r\n\r\n```\r\nI do not know what dockerwatch is or does, but the following worked for me:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker@boot2docker:/mnt/sde1/tmp$ curl localhost:8012\r\n<html>\r\n    <head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n    <title>dockerwatch</title>\r\n    </head><ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\nThis looked promising.\r\n\r\nI hoped to be able to point the root to www, but I didn't know how. I tried to find the file which was invoked with that empty and incomplete unordered list, but `grep -ril \"<title>dockerwatch</title>\"` just kept working with no output for hours. \r\n\r\nNext I tried to redefine Dockerfile:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# test\r\nWORKDIR www\r\n#CMD [\"/dockerwatch/bin/dockerwatch\", \"foreground\"]\r\ntail -f /tmp/cookie.txt\r\n```\r\nbut this trick didn't work either. Where does Cowboy come into play? \r\n\r\nTo make a long story short: I have no idea what I'm doing here. Could you please help me? \r\n\r\nI just want to use Cowboy like Caddy or Apache or NGINX or Yaws. How am I going to do that? \r\n\r\nI don't know anything about Elixir and I sure don't want to use a monster container like the one from 99s (ontouchstart/cowboy 1.47GB, https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy). \r\n\r\nAfter many hours of research for something which should be very easy to find (docker alpine cowboy) I run out of ideas.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/unix1/ex_fcgi/issues/3","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/unix1/ex_fcgi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/unix1/ex_fcgi/issues/3/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/unix1/ex_fcgi/issues/3/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/unix1/ex_fcgi/issues/3/events","html_url":"https://github.com/unix1/ex_fcgi/issues/3","id":582932510,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1ODI5MzI1MTA=","number":3,"title":"Error bad_return / *WARNING* Missing application sasl ","user":{"login":"kklepper","id":6130319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzAzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6130319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kklepper","html_url":"https://github.com/kklepper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kklepper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kklepper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kklepper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kklepper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kklepper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kklepper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kklepper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kklepper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kklepper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-03-17T11:06:14Z","updated_at":"2020-03-21T16:53:56Z","closed_at":"2020-03-21T16:41:42Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nLoïs sent me here. \r\n\r\nI want to use Cowboy like Yaws or Caddy or Apache or NGINX in a stack serving PHP in a docker alpine container.
