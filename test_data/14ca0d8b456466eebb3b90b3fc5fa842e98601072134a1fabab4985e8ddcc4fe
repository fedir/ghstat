based on item size and count\n\nIssue:\nWe use page concept on DataList and DataGridList. When item count is not devided by controls per page, last page can have different page height from others. The adjustBuffer function of VerticalDelegate and VerticalGridDelegate calculate buffer size by accumulating page size. But, we use default page size when the page is not generated yet. So, the buffer size is different between before and after generating the last page.\n\nFix:\nCalculate buffer size based on item size and item collection length instead of page size and page height. And divide item collection length by number of columns in case of GridList.\n\nEnyo-DCO-1.1-Signed-off-by: Kunmyon Choi kunmyon.choi@lge.com","tree":{"sha":"0772d9dc5666dd58d15111eb0823db0626661c61","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo/git/trees/0772d9dc5666dd58d15111eb0823db0626661c61"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo/git/commits/40874a147027b7a4bcad1
