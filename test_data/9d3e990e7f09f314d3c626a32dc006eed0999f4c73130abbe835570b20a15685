Furthermore, the tutorial does not provide any instructions on how to persist the data.  How do you connect to mysql? Does ChicagoBoss create a db in mysql for me?  Or, do I have to create the db in mysql by hand?  \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, all those things should be addressed in the tutorial.\r\n\r\nThis is what I got to mostly work** (see end of my comment).  In the root of the project, there is a file called boss.config.  I made these changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n%% Database %%\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\r\n%% db_host - The hostname of the database. Defaults to \"localhost\".\r\n%% db_port - The port of the database. Defaults to 1978.\r\n%% db_adapter - The database adapter to use. Valid values are:\r\n%%     mock - In-memory (non-persistent) database, useful for testing\r\n%%     mnesia - Mnesia\r\n%%     mongodb- MongoDB\r\n%%     mysql - MySQL\r\n%%     pgsql - PostgreSQL\r\n%%     riak - Riak\r\n%%     tyrant - Tokyo Tyrant\r\n%% db_username - The username used for connecting to the database (if\r\n%%   needed).\r\n%% db_password - The password used for connecting to the database (if\r\n%%   needed).\r\n%% db_database - The name of the database to connect to (if needed).\r\n%% db_cache_enable - Whether to enable the cache in boss_db. Defaults\r\n%%   to false. Requires cache_enable to be set to true.\r\n%% db_configure - Database adapter specific configuration options. Defaults to [].\r\n\r\n    {db_host, \"localhost\"},\r\n%   {db_port, 1978}, I commented this out\r\n%   {db_adapter, mock},  I commented this out\r\n%\r\n%   {db_username, \"boss\"},\r\n%   {db_password, \"boss\"},\r\n%   {db_database, \"boss\"},\r\n%   {db_configure, []},\r\n%\r\n% I added these:\r\n   {db_port, 3306},  %defaut mysql port\r\n   {db_adapter, mysql},\r\n   {db_username, \"root\"},\r\n   {db_password, \"\"},\r\n   {db_database, \"mydb\"},  %I created mydb in mysql.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm actually using mariadb, but it is supposed to be a drop in replacement for mysql.  I start mariadb like this:\r\n\r\n`~$ mysql.server start`\r\n\r\nthen I log into mysql like this:\r\n\r\n`~$ mysql -u root`\r\n\r\nwhich gets me to a mysql prompt:\r\n\r\n`mysql>`\r\n\r\nAt the mysql prompt, I did the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmysql> show databases;\r\nmysql> CREATE DATABASE mydb CHARACTER SET utf8\r\nmysql> show databases;\r\nmysql> use mydb;\r\nmysql> show tables;\r\n\r\nmysql> CREATE TABLE greetings (\r\n    -> id INT(12) not null auto_increment primary key,\r\n    -> greeting_text VARCHAR(100)\r\n    -> );\r\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)\r\n\r\nmysql> describe greetings;\r\n+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\r\n| Field         | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |\r\n+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\r\n| id            | int(12)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |\r\n| greeting_text | varchar(100) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |\r\n+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\r\n2 rows in set (0.01 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\n If things weren't working correctly, when I entered `http://localhost:8001/greeting/list` in my browser, I  saw output like the following in the terminal window where I started the server: \r\n\r\n```\r\n18:58:08.243 [notice] Module \"greeting\" Parameters ['Id','GreetingText'] Attributes[{compile,export_all}]\r\n18:58:08.275 [info] Query SELECT * FROM greetings WHERE  TRUE ORDER BY id ASC\r\n18:58:08.275 [error] SQL Error: \"Table 'mydb.greetings' doesn't exist\"  <#### HERE *****\r\n18:58:08.331 [info] GET /greeting/list [cb_tutorial] 200 106ms\r\n\r\n```\r\nLook for a line that starts with `[error]`.  \r\n\r\nAfter hooking up mysql, I could do this (by the way, I have to hit return to see the server prompt):\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n...\r\ninclude\"]},{compiler_options,[{parse_transform,lager_transform},return_errors]}] \r\n19:28:57.763 [notice] Compile file \"/Users/7stud/chicago_boss_apps/cb_tutorial/priv/init/cb_tutorial_01_news.erl\" with options [{include_dirs,[\"/Users/7stud/chicago_boss_apps/cb_tutorial/include\"]}]\r\n\r\n(cb_tutorial@Me)1> Greeting1 = greeting:new(id, \"Hello, world.\").\r\n{greeting,id,\"Hello, world.\"}\r\n\r\n(cb_tutorial@Me)2> Greeting1:save().\r\n19:29:46.469 [info] Query INSERT INTO greetings (`greeting_text`) values ('Hello, world.')\r\n19:29:46.471 [info] Query SELECT last_insert_id()\r\n{ok,{greeting,\"greeting-1\",\"Hello, world.\"}}\r\n\r\n(cb_tutorial@Me)3> Greeting2 = greeting:new(id, \"Goodbye, mars.\").\r\n{greeting,id,\"Goodbye, mars.\"}\r\n\r\n(cb_tutorial@Me)4> Greeting2:save().\r\n19:30:35.131 [info] Query INSERT INTO greetings (`greeting_text`) values ('Goodbye, mars.')\r\n19:30:35.133 [info] Query SELECT last_insert_id()\r\n{ok,{greeting,\"greeting-2\",\"Goodbye, mars.\"}}\r\n\r\n(cb_tutorial@Me)5> boss_db:find(greeting, []).\r\n19:31:08.949 [info] Query SELECT * FROM greetings WHERE  TRUE ORDER BY id ASC\r\n[{greeting,\"greeting-1\",<<\"Hello, world.\">>},\r\n {greeting,\"greeting-2\",<<\"Goodbye, mars.\">>}]\r\n```\r\nThen when I hit `Ctrl+C`, then type `a` to abort, I can start up the server again, and my data is still there:\r\n```\r\n(cb_tutorial@Me)6>  \r\nBREAK: (a)bort (c)ontinue (p)roc info (i)nfo (l)oaded\r\n       (v)ersion (k)ill (D)b-tables (d)istribution\r\na\r\n\r\n~/chicago_boss_apps/cb_tutorial$ ./init-dev.sh\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\r\n\r\n(cb_tutorial@Me)1> boss_db:find(greeting, []).\r\n19:31:41.837 [info] Query SELECT * FROM greetings WHERE  TRUE ORDER BY id ASC\r\n[{greeting,\"greeting-1\",<<\"Hello, world.\">>},\r\n {greeting,\"greeting-2\",<<\"Goodbye, mars.\">>}]\r\n\r\n(cb_tutorial@Me)2> \r\n```\r\n\r\n**However, something isn't quite working correctly because when I delete a greeting I get an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncb_tutorial@Me)7> boss_db:delete(\"greeting-4\").\r\n19:47:55.196 [info] Query SELECT * FROM greetings WHERE id = 4\r\n19:47:55.198 [info] Query DELETE FROM greetings WHERE id = 4\r\n19:47:55.213 [info] Query DELETE FROM counters WHERE name = 'greeting-4'\r\nok\r\n(cb_tutorial@Me)8> 19:47:55.213 [error] SQL Error: \"Table 'mydb.counters' doesn't exist\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see in the `[info]` output that after ChicagoBoss deletes the greeting from the `greetings` table, ChicagoBoss then tries to delete the greeting from a table called `counters`.  I notice when I added a greeting, there was no output showing an attempt to add something to the `counters` table.  The error doesn't affect how the web page works, though.\r\n\r\nOkay, I found some info on the [counters table](https://github.com/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss/blob/6a455b98b7e1b08c1119e96d36b23155d223722d/READMEs/README_DATABASE.md) and setting up a persistent db in general.  It looks like you can ignore that error.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss/issues/675","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss/issues/675/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss/issues/675/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss/issues/675/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss/issues/675","id":267417314,"number":675,"title":"Compile does not work on OTP 21","user":{"login":"ZelphirKaltstahl","id":11130348,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11130348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZelphirKaltstahl","html_url":"https://github.com/ZelphirKaltstahl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZelphirKaltstahl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZelphirKaltstahl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZelphirKaltstahl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZelphirKaltstahl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZelphirKaltstahl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZelphirKaltstahl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZelphirKaltstahl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZelphirKaltstahl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZelphirKaltstahl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-10-21T21:57:43Z","updated_at":"2018-02-25T07:02:09Z","closed_at":"2018-02-25T07:02:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I try to run the commands from the readme to compile the framework with dependencies, I get the following output:\r\n\r\n\r\n    $ make\r\n    ==> goldrush (get-deps)\r\n    ==> lager (get-deps)\r\n    ==> pmod_transform (get-deps)\r\n    ==> erlando (get-deps)\r\n    ==> aleppo (get-deps)\r\n    ==> medici (get-deps)\r\n    ==> jsx (get-deps)\r\n    ==> ibrowse (get-deps)\r\n    ==> ddb (get-deps)\r\n    ==> epgsql (get-deps)\r\n    ==> erlmc (get-deps)\r\n    ==> mysql (get-deps)\r\n    ==> poolboy (get-deps)\r\n    ==> uuid (get-deps)\r\n    ==> redo (get-deps)\r\n    ==> ets_cache (get-deps)\r\n    ==> proper (get-deps)\r\n    ==> dh_date (get-deps)\r\n    ==> tiny_pq (get-deps)\r\n    ==> boss_test (get-deps)\r\n    ==> boss_db (get-deps)\r\n    ==> tinymq (get-deps)\r\n    ==> erlydtl (get-deps)\r\n    ==> dynamic_compile (get-deps)\r\n    ==> jaderl (get-deps)\r\n    ==> gen_smtp (get-deps)\r\n    ==> iso8601 (get-deps)\r\n    ==> mimetypes (get-deps)\r\n    ==> mochiweb (get-deps)\r\n    ==> cowlib (get-deps)\r\n    ==> ranch (get-deps)\r\n    ==> cowboy (get-deps)\r\n    ==> simple_bridge (get-deps)\r\n    ==> ChicagoBoss (get-deps)\r\n    ==> goldrush (compile)\r\n    ==> lager (compile)\r\n    ==> pmod_transform (compile)\r\n    ==> erlando (compile)\r\n    ==> aleppo (compile)\r\n    ==> medici (compile)\r\n    ==> jsx (compile)\r\n    ERROR: OTP release 21 does not match required regex R16|17|18|19|20\r\n    ERROR: compile failed while processing /home/user/development/Erlang/ChicagoBoss/deps/jsx: rebar_abort\r\n    Makefile:14: recipe for target 'compile' failed\r\n    make: *** [compile] Error 1\r\n\r\nI think it's a matter of allowing OTP 21 in a list of allowed releases.
