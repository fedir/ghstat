Press the \"run\" button to trigger the initial render.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe console should print \"slot missing\" and \"default slot content\" should appear in the rendered div.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe console prints \"slot present\" and nothing appears in the rendered div. It seems like the `v-if` is being moved from the slot itself to the slot contents (which is why executing the slot returns nothing rather than \"custom slot contents\").\r\n\r\n---\r\nConsumers of my component may want to customize how a particular piece is being rendered. Using `v-if` to toggle this always results in the slot being defined in `this.$scopedSlots`. Based on [this commit](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/68bdbf508b915872627676d6bf987bdac9e5fe97) it would seem that putting a `v-if` on a scoped slot is valid usage.\r\n\r\nI could in theory check `this.$scopedSlots.content()` to see if they provided the slot, but this doesn't allow me to determine whether the user provided no slot, or they intentionally provided an empty slot.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Since numbers can't be used for functions anyway. Or since filters are defined as properties within the `filters` object, we could at least scan if the filter exists.\r\n\r\n> Vue.js actually supports the full power of JavaScript expressions inside all data bindings\r\n\r\nThis part of the documentation would be a lie otherwise. If you do not agree with the proposed change, I would at least document these exceptions there.

Steps to reproduce\r\nAt the demo in **Reproduction link**, hit **Click Me!** button then you will see the hook=**componentUpdated** is not called.\r\n\r\nThen when click **change data** (execute

the custome directive should be called after the containing component’s VNode and the VNodes of its children have updated. but it seems be `the VNodes of its children have been remounted, not updated`\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nif one child component only update its own data, it will not trigger the hook=componentUpdated of the directive at the parent component.\r\n\r\n<!--

With no setTimeout() it happens sporadically depending on load times. If I remove the `<transition-group>` then the rendering never fails.\r\n\r\nThe error message is:\r\n```\r\n[Vue warn]: Error in updated hook: \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'cloneNode' of undefined\"\r\n\r\nfound in\r\n\r\n---> <TransitionGroup>\r\n       <CCoachList> at src\\components\\cCoachList.vue\r\n         <CCoachDirectory> at src\\components\\pages\\cCoachDirectory.vue\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\ntransition-group loads components as they become available\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nif components take too long to load, the first item in the in the group displays correctly, the others fail\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
