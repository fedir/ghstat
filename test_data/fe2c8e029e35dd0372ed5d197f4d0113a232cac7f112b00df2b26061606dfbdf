If I want to modify a prop, I will have to define a data attribute that can be modified but I can not use this friendly name that I gave to the prop.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to be able to proxy the props to an instance variable or to add a prefix without proxying to this. So we would have a public interface for props with friendly names that would be available for the data attributes in the component.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```javascript\r\nVue.component('select', {\r\n  proxy: {\r\n    // Here we can define proxy rules\r\n  },\r\n  props: ['items'],\r\n  data: function() {\r\n    return {\r\n      items: [];\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  created() {\r\n    this.items = this.props.items;\r\n    // or\r\n    this.items = this.props_items;\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think you understood the idea.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Then open https://jsfiddle.net/StephenM/vvj23rae/39/ and https://jsfiddle.net/StephenM/vvj23rae/33/ and observe that that same `v-for` works just fine. The interpolation works in all three cases.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI would expect that all three of these uses of the component work:\r\n\r\n    <counter-component value=\"14\" />\r\n    <counter-component v-bind:value=\"15\" />\r\n    <counter-component :value=\"16\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nOr that the documentation (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#v-for-with-a-Range) reflects the fact that only the latter two will work. That if a component property is used as the range parameter for `v-for`, that property cannot be set to a literal and must be bound.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`v-for` only works with an integer range defined by a component property if that component has that property bound. However, interpolations work with component properties even if that property is set to a literal constant where the component is used.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI was fooled by the fact that the interpolation in the h3 tag works in all three cases but the v-for directive only works in the latter two. I wasted hours trying various variants of the syntax because, while I will certainly use a binding in a live application, I was trying out the integer-range support in the v-for directive for the first time and had plonked multiple instances of the component I was building onto a page with different values of the value property, all set as constants.\r\n\r\nI ended up posting [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49316942/vue-v-for-directive-with-integer-range-bound-to-component-property) about it. The question was promptly answered and I now understand my mistake but I think that this behaviour is either a bug or a failure in the documentation and so I am opening this issue anyway.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
