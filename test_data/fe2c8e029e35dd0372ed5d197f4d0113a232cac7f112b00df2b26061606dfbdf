This is as expected. (Uses suggested pattern for Vuex with v-model at https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/forms.html)\r\n\r\n* See \"lastName\" field has an initial value of \"[object Object]\". This isn't expected.\r\n* Type something into \"lastName\" field and see the value is NOT immediately output to the right. This isn't expected. \r\n* Tab out of the \"lastName\" field and notice now it will output to the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n1. On load, both inputs should be empty.\r\n2. Typing into lastName should behave the same way as firstName (immediate output to side on 'input' event, not just focus out)\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n1. lastName input has \"[object Object]\"\r\n2. Typing into lastName does nothing to our output until you \"focus out\"\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm basically wanting to nest custom getter/setter properties under a top-level computed property. I'm doing this because I'd like to nest all my forms fields under a computed property called \"form\" that returns an object where each property is itself an object defining the getter/setter to the Vuex store. \r\n\r\nI can potentially flatten these all with a map method that creates a computed property (getter/setter) for each field like `fieldName   \"Field\"` but the reason I'm trying to do this is to normalize a Vue plugin's usage across component state vs vuex state. \r\n\r\nAlso, if this nesting means that the \"form\" property with nestings is recalculated every time a field changes, let me know as obviously that'd be a performance consideration that may drive me to the flat style and force me to figure out how I document the plugin's usage.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
