It will return undefined or the function does not exist\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nIn the template code which consumes the slot, when we use the  slot-scope attribute, we get a plain Object. However we need the class structure to invoke functions, access getters, etc.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWe can't access the class structure of the object that was bind as we're just getting a new Object instance rather than the reference.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is related to https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4529 which lets the slot bind to an object. The thing is, I would like to invoke the functions of the object's class that was passed over. With the current situation, it is not doable as it's creating a new Object instance instead of just referencing the object which was bind to the slot.\r\n\r\nBy the way it actually works on String templates, but on the .vue file it doesn't. I am new to jsfiddle that's why I don't know how to do an import for the single-file components. I hope that would be fine to check out.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

So much. ❤️\r\n\r\nHowever, there's one implementation detail in them that bugs me from time to time:\r\n\r\nComputed Properties are often pretty simple calculations or string concatenations, and I find it tedious to have them always cover up three lines of code. (One for the property name, one for the implementation, one for the closing curly brace. You can of course put that in one line, but it usually makes the implementation looks less obvious / rather confusing.)\r\n\r\nArrow functions are an elegant solution to those simple mappings, but, as we all know, they're not applicable to Computed Properties because of their different `this` context.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nSince Computed Properties currently don't take any arguments, it would be relatively cheap (regarding implementation effort and possible BC changes) to not only bind their `this` context to the according Vue instance, but also pass it as a parameter.\r\n\r\n#### Basic Example\r\nIt would allow for elegant solutions like this:\r\n```javascript\r\nnew Vue({\r\n  data: {\r\n    firstName: 'John',\r\n    lastName: 'Doe'\r\n  },\r\n  computed: {\r\n    fullName: vm => `${vm.firstName} ${vm.lastName}`\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr even:\r\n```javascript\r\nfullName: ({ firstName, lastName }) => `${firstName} ${lastName}`\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Getters / Setters\r\nThe only point where I could see this API getting slightly ugly are Computed Property setters, as they already receive a parameter and would have to take the `vm` as the second argument (to avoid breaking changes).\r\n\r\nGetters / setters could be omitted from this topic entirely (i.e. staying unchanged) as they are usually not that concise anyway. However, for consistency I'd propose to have them receive the Vue instance as well, in the setter as the second argument:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfullName: {\r\n  get: vm => `${vm.firstName} ${vm.lastName}`,\r\n  set: (newValue, vm) => {\r\n    // Not of the greatest value here, we could just use a regular function and `this`\r\n    const names = newValue.split(' ')\r\n    vm.firstName = names[0]\r\n    vm.lastName = names[names.length - 1]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Conclusion\r\nAs far as I can tell, this whole approach should not break any existing code. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it's not a feature available for userland implementation, that's why I felt it would be appropriate for a feature request.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear your thoughts about this. 🙂 \r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
