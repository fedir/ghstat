when investigating this issue with Agora: https://github.com/bpfkorea/agora/issues/796\r\n\r\n# Context\r\n\r\nA few months ago we unintentionally (and carelessly, to be fair) did a subtle change: we transitioned from silently ignoring `put` on closed message boxes to a hard failure (`assert`). See https://github.com/Geod24/localrest/commit/814377a268953a06c2f1237fc16d3195cb83f80f#diff-7e552a35c6e12cbbfb124195a3e45cd2R1126-R1127\r\nThis is something we *do* want, as we're transitioning from message boxes to channels. In the channel model, calling `put` on a closed channel leads to a hard failure (`panic` in Go).\r\n\r\n# Today's bug\r\n\r\nAs I was trying to upgrade LocalRest, the test-suite started to fail. I quickly tracked it down to the aforementioned commit, then spent a few more hours understanding what was going on.\r\n\r\nIn Agora we have a few asynchronous tasks that perform recurrent actions on timers (e.g. catching-up).\r\nThose tasks currently live independently, and cannot be stopped. In normal mode, they are just run by Vibe.d, while in LocalRest, they are a fiber that gets scheduled periodically.\r\n\r\nThis is all nice until one tries to shut down the node. Because they do periodic send, they will hit the assert (no one told them the connection was closed, heh), and that'll lead to weird crashes, because threads. I originally thought we needed to stop those tasks, but it's a client-side solution for a library-side problem, and a very un-elegant one.\r\n\r\n# Tentative solution\r\n\r\nMy original approach was simply to add handling code in the sender code to simulate a timeout (which is what one would most likely see in the real world). Spoiler alert: It didn't work. Since it's a race condition. *sometimes* the task that dies is the one that does the request, so when the node respond, *poof*, closed message box.\r\n\r\nThis then led to another realization: doing the following is subject to the same race condition:\r\n```D\r\nif (!tid.mbox.isClosed())\r\n    send(tid, ...);\r\n```\r\nBecause essentially, the message box could have been closed between the check and the send.\r\nThis means we need to provide, at the `MessageBox` level, a way to ignore failures, as we need the check to happen after the lock is taken.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bpfkorea/agora/issues/878","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bpfkorea/agora","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bpfkorea/agora/issues/878/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bpfkorea/agora/issues/878/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bpfkorea/agora/issues/878/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bpfkorea/agora/issues/878","id":625335815,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MjUzMzU4MTU=","number":878,"title":"Node.start() call is still blocking","user":{"login":"AndrejMitrovic","id":15028641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI4NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15028641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrejMitrovic","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrejMitrovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrejMitrovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrejMitrovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrejMitrovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrejMitrovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrejMitrovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrejMitrovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrejMitrovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrejMitrovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrejMitrovic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-05-27T02:53:25Z","updated_at":"2020-06-02T09:47:24Z","closed_at":"2020-06-02T09:47:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"This is the cause of the timeouts we see after calling start(), for example in https://github.com/bpfkorea/agora/pull/845.\r\n\r\nHere:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bpfkorea/agora/blob/38b2c33cc56acdeeabce8158bf3231a1f51eb5b1/source/agora/node/Validator.d#L77\r\n\r\nWhat this code was supposed to do is to schedule a task and immediately return.
