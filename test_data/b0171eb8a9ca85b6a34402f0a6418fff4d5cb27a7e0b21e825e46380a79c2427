is because there is no way to free resources of job schedulers.\r\n\r\nSince there is no official example of TScheduler class I had to find myself how to start and stop job schedulers. So I tried the following ways:\r\n\r\nFirst, my job scheduler:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MyScheduledJob : public TScheduler\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n     MyScheduledJob(QObject *parent=NULL) : TScheduler(parent) {\r\n        tInfo(\"MyScheduledJob\");\r\n     }\r\n  ~MyScheduledJob() {\r\n        tInfo(\"~MyScheduledJob\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprotected:\r\n    void job() {\r\n        tInfo(\"MyScheduledJob::job()\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Case 1. Declare job scheduler as member of ApplicationController.**\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work - the docs says that the controller should not have member variables (last paragraph of http://www.treefrogframework.org/en/user-guide/controller/)\r\n\r\n**Case 2. Declare job scheduler as static member in ApplicationController:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass T_CONTROLLER_EXPORT ApplicationController : public TActionController\r\n{\r\n    Q_OBJECT\r\npublic:\r\n    ApplicationController()\r\n        : TActionController() { }\r\npublic slots:\r\n    void staticInitialize();\r\n    void staticRelease();\r\nprivate:\r\n    static MyScheduledJob m_myScheduledJob;\r\n};\r\n\r\nMyScheduledJob ApplicationController::m_myScheduledJob;\r\n\r\nvoid ApplicationController::staticInitialize()\r\n{\r\n    m_myScheduledJob.start(60*1000);\r\n}\r\nvoid ApplicationController::staticRelease()\r\n{\r\n    m_myScheduledJob.stop();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe above code crashes my unit test at startup when controller.dll is loaded - I link my unit test with controller library (mytest.pro):\r\n\r\nLIBS += -L$$PWD/../lib -lcontroller -lhelper -lmodel -lview\r\n\r\n**Case 3. Declare job scheduler as static pointer member in ApplicationController:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass T_CONTROLLER_EXPORT ApplicationController : public TActionController\r\n{\r\n    Q_OBJECT\r\npublic:\r\n    ApplicationController()\r\n        : TActionController() { }\r\npublic slots:\r\n    void staticInitialize();\r\n    void staticRelease();\r\nprivate:\r\n    static MyScheduledJob *m_myScheduledJob;\r\n};\r\n\r\nMyScheduledJob ApplicationController::*m_myScheduledJob = NULL;\r\n\r\nvoid ApplicationController::staticInitialize()\r\n{\r\n    m_myScheduledJob = new MyScheduledJob();\r\n    m_myScheduledJob->start(60*1000);\r\n}\r\nvoid ApplicationController::staticRelease()\r\n{\r\n    m_myScheduledJob->stop();\r\n    delete m_myScheduledJob;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works, but I get the following warning in treefrog.log:\r\n\r\n> WARN  [7760] QObject::killTimer: Timers cannot be stopped from another thread (kernel\\qobject.cpp:1688 void __thiscall QObject::killTimer(int))\r\n> WARN  [7760] QObject::~QObject: Timers cannot be stopped from another thread (kernel\\qobject.cpp:247 __thiscall QObjectPrivate::~QObjectPrivate(void))\r\n\r\n**Case 4. Same as case 3 but use deleteLater() instead of delete.**\r\n\r\n```\r\nMyScheduledJob ApplicationController::*m_myScheduledJob = NULL;\r\n\r\nvoid ApplicationController::staticInitialize()\r\n{\r\n        m_myScheduledJob = new MyScheduledJob();\r\n        m_myScheduledJob->start(60*1000);\r\n}\r\nvoid ApplicationController::staticRelease()\r\n{\r\n    m_myScheduledJob->stop();\r\n    m_myScheduledJob->deleteLater();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorks, but the destructor of MyScheduledJob is not called and causes a memory leak.\r\nThis is because the staticRelease() is called when the main event loop has already stopped (see http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qobject.html#deleteLater)\r\n\r\n**My suggested solution:**\r\n\r\nIn order the case 4 to work the ApplicationController::staticRelease() should be called when event loop is still running, possibly by connecting to QCoreApplication::aboutToQuit() signal (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcoreapplication.html#aboutToQuit).\r\n\r\nThe change should be done in main():\r\nhttps://github.com/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework/blob/master/tools/tfserver/main.cpp\r\n\r\n```\r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n{\r\n    TWebApplication webapp(argc, argv);\r\n    TApplicationServerBase *server = 0;\r\n\r\n    // ....\r\n\r\n    if (!server->start(debug)) {\r\n        tSystemError(\"Server open failed\");\r\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Server open failed\\n\");\r\n        goto finish;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ret = webapp.exec();        // runs the event loop\r\n    server->stop();             // this calls ApplicationController::staticRelease(),\r\n                                // when the event loop has already stopped.\r\n                                // SUGGESTED SOLUTION:\r\n                                // Try change these lines to (not tested):\r\n                                //  connect(&webapp, SIGNAL(aboutToQuit()),\r\n                                            server, SLOT(deleteLater()));\r\n                                // ret = webapp.exec(); \r\n                                // and make sure the the destructor of server\r\n                                // ~TThreadApplicationServer() calls stop()\r\nfinish:\r\n    // Release loggers\r\n    Tf::releaseAppLoggers();\r\n    Tf::releaseQueryLogger();\r\n    Tf::releaseAccessLogger();\r\n    Tf::releaseSystemLogger();\r\n\r\n    _exit(ret);\r\n    return ret;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBTW: There is no `delete server` after `server->stop() `- another memory leak ?\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework/issues/94","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework/issues/94/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework/issues/94/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework/issues/94/events","html_url":"https://github.com/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework/issues/94","id":183325733,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxODMzMjU3MzM=","number":94,"title":"QSqlDatabase: QMYSQL driver not loaded","user":{"login":"Spoon94","id":18432744,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDMyNzQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/18432744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spoon94","html_url":"https://github.com/Spoon94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spoon94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spoon94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spoon94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spoon94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spoon94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spoon94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spoon94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spoon94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spoon94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-10-17T05:00:12Z","updated_at":"2016-12-10T00:31:09Z","closed_at":"2016-12-10T00:31:09Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"when I use tspawn --show-tables on my mac the error occurs with the hint:\nDriverType:   QMYSQL\nQSqlDatabase: QMYSQL driver not loaded\nQSqlDatabase: available drivers: QSQLITE QMYSQL QMYSQL3 QODBC QODBC3 QPSQL QPSQL7\nParameter 'DriverType' is invalid or RDB client library not available.\n###### \n\nI have recomplie mysql driver with qt.How can I fix this issue?\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework/issues/31","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework/issues/31/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework/issues/31/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework/issues/31/events","html_url":"https://github.com/treefrogframework/treefrog-framework/issues/31","id":36217269,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjIxNzI2OQ==","number":31,"title":"Unable to make & make install tools","user":{"login":"mgrigajtis","id":238225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/238225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgrigajtis","html_url":"https://github.com/mgrigajtis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgrigajtis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgrigajtis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgrigajtis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgrigajtis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgrigajtis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgrigajtis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgrigajtis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgrigajtis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgrigajtis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-06-21T05:21:51Z","updated_at":"2014-08-31T02:45:59Z","closed_at":"2014-08-31T02:45:59Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Configured like this:\n./configure --framework=/path/that/doesn't/need/root/privileges\ncd src\nmake;
