Template::Toolkit default configuration used in `Dancer::Template::TemplateToolkit` is not the default configuration suggested by TT2. Moreover the configuration parameters are inconsistent or incomplete. The TT2 config requires all configuration params to be in upper case (`ANYCASE`, `START_TAG`, ...).\nFor very understandable reasons of readability the `Dancer2::Template::TemplateToolkit` introduced a different way to write the most important config params.\n- `START_TAG` => `start_tag`\n- `END_TAG` => (`stop_tag` or `end_tag`)\n- `INCLUDE_PATH` => (`include_path`)\n\nThis is very hard on people knowing the TT2 config params (or looking them up in the documentation). Therefore I would like to suggest to fix this by slowly introducing the correct writing of upper case configuration variables in the config.yml.\n\nWe could still for a given amount of time leave the mapping for the above-mentionned tags in, but should slowly fade them out in order to be fully consistent.\n\nFurthermore, the default setting of `ANYCASE => 1` in `... ::TemplateToolkit` has a real performance impact and should probably be faded out aswell?\n\nthx for your opinion on it, I'd be happy to implement the change if you agree.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1147","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1147/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1147/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1147/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1147","id":128406347,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMjg0MDYzNDc=","number":1147,"title":"Issue #1123 again: On Windows, t\\02_request\\04_custom.t fails due to temporary file creation error","user":{"login":"nanis","id":288163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODE2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/288163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanis","html_url":"https://github.com/nanis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-24T16:02:40Z","updated_at":"2016-02-01T15:07:41Z","closed_at":"2016-02-01T15:07:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is the same mistake as in #1123.

That call happens after the environment is destroyed.\n\nNow, `File::Spec::Win32` inherits from `File::Spec::Unix`, and uses the  `_cached_tmpdir` implementation from the latter:\n\n```\nsub _cached_tmpdir {\n    shift;\n    local $^W;\n    return if grep $ENV{$_} ne $tmpenv{$_}, @_;\n    return $tmpdir;\n}\n```\n\nThis seems to me to imply that when you destroy `%ENV` in the test, and subsequently, an `HTTP::Body` is constructed, `File::Spec`'s cached value of `tmpdir` should be invalidated as it happens here. However, for reasons unknown to me, this test does not fail on my Mac or Linux machines, just on my Visual Studio built `perl` 5.22.0 on Windows 8.1.\n\nRegardless, given that `File::Spec` does invalidate cached values when the values in `%ENV` do not match `%tmpenv`, I think the test is flawed.\n\nLocalizing `%ENV` for each block seems to \"work\" on Windows, but I haven't tried it anywhere else at this point:\n\n```\n{\n    local %ENV = (\n        'REQUEST_METHOD'    => 'GET',\n        'HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE' => 'application/json',\n        'HTTP_ACCEPT'       => 'text/xml',\n        'HTTP_ACCEPT_TYPE'  => 'text/x-yaml',\n        'PATH_INFO'         => '/',\n    );\n\n    my $req = Dancer::Request->new( env => \\%ENV );\n    Dancer::SharedData->request($req);\n    my $ct = Dancer::Serializer::Mutable::_request_content_types($req);\n    is_deeply $ct, [ 'application/json' ];\n    $ct = Dancer::Serializer::Mutable::_response_content_types($req);\n    is_deeply $ct, [ 'text/xml', 'text/x-yaml', 'application/json' ];\n}\n\n{\n    local %ENV = (\n        'REQUEST_METHOD' => 'PUT',\n        'PATH_INFO'      => '/',\n    );\n    my $req = Dancer::Request->new( env => \\%ENV );\n    Dancer::SharedData->request($req);\n    my $ct = Dancer::Serializer::Mutable::_request_content_types($req);\n    is_deeply $ct, ['application/json'];\n    $ct = Dancer::Serializer::Mutable::_response_content_types($req);\n    is_deeply $ct, ['application/json'];\n}\n\n{\n    local %ENV = (\n        'REQUEST_METHOD' => 'PUT',\n        'PATH_INFO'      => '/',\n        'HTTP_ACCEPT'    => 'text/xml',\n        'CONTENT_TYPE'   => 'application/json',\n    );\n    my $req = Dancer::Request->new( env => \\%ENV );\n    Dancer::SharedData->request($req);\n    my $ct = Dancer::Serializer::Mutable::_response_content_types($req);\n    is_deeply $ct, [ 'text/xml', 'application/json' ];\n}\n```\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1121","id":90159775,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MDE1OTc3NQ==","number":1121,"title":"Default config drops log files in working directory","user":{"login":"yanick","id":19954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick","html_url":"https://github.com/yanick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2015-06-22T17:22:29Z","updated_at":"2015-07-13T15:57:13Z","closed_at":"2015-06-25T19:54:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"From the dancer-user mailing list\n\nHi,\n\nDelurking, because the latest version of Dancer is causing our unit tests at $WORK to start creating empty log files inside the current working directory. This is easily-reproducible: e.g.\n\n> sam@chimera64:tmp$ cat spamlogfile.pl \n> # !/usr/bin/env perl\n> \n> use Dancer qw(halt);\n> sam@chimera64:tmp$ rm -fr logs; perl spamlogfile.pl\n> sam@chimera64:tmp$ ls -lah logs/\n> total 40K\n> drwxr-xr-x  2 sam  sam  4.0K Jun 22 17:01 .\n> drwxrwxrwt 10 root root  36K Jun 22 17:01 ..\n> -rw-r--r--  1 sam  sam     0 Jun 22 17:01 development.log\n\nA workaround is to say use Dancer qw(:syntax), but there are two problems with that:\n\n(1) this is a change in behaviour that wasn’t documented as such, and it requires all auxiliary non-server Dancer code to be changed; and\n\n(2) passing :syntax imports all sorts of Dancer symbols that can potentially clash with a parent class.\n\nI’ve spent the afternoon debugging point 2. Our end-to-end tests run under Test::Dancer, and we have a separate class that tests individual method calls as if they were Dancer requests (including setting the status code in case of errors). It previously said use Dancer () and explicitly called Dancer::status - and under Dancer 1.3138, running unit tests using this class would generate spurious empty log files.\n\nI patched that to say use Dancer qw(:syntax) - and now the code fails because the parent class implements methods true, false and redirect, which the method call class never gets to call because it’s had Dancer’s symbols stuck in its own package instead. So this now needs to say use Dancer qw(:syntax !true !false !redirect), and in practice I needed to write an automated test script that checked that all of a parent class’s methods were explicitly not imported from Dancer, because if I change anything upstream I need to change the import statement in the child classes.\n\nThe problem appears to have been introduced in https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer/commit/e9e4e087528c2734dd6e9c922105eac3cd2e53e7\n\nThe actual problem is further down in Dancer::Config - line 227 in 1.3138 - where the settings are read. $SETTINGS at this point contains default values, and part of setting confdir involves creating a logs subdirectory. Previously the code wouldn’t get this far.\n\nPresumably a workaround would be to not create a log directory immediately, but then if you were running a real Dancer server you’d want to know as soon as possible that your log directory wasn’t writable, so that’s not going to be acceptable to many people.\n\nAlternatively, any code that says e.g. use Dancer qw(halt status) should be seen as clearly not wanting to actually start a Dancer server or anything like that. That sounds like a scary change to make, though.\n\nOr you could defer parsing of the Dancer config until something actually happens. That’s also vague and terrifying.\n\nOr just revert that particular commit / PR. I don’t fully understand why it does what it does, though. If there’s a way of cleanly telling apart (1) a hash of settings that was explicitly passed to Dancer from (2) the default settings that, chances are, you didn’t intend to use, that would  be the best solution to my mind.\n\nSam\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1120","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1120/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1120/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1120/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1120","id":89509774,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4OTUwOTc3NA==","number":1120,"title":"Session

Ideally, it should be possible to do the clever stuff on demand (without necessarily importing symbols) with something like `use Dancer (); Dancer::initialise;` or `use Dancer qw(:app);`. I have a suspicion this might break things for some people.\n\nThe only way round this I can see for me is always using `use Dancer qw(:syntax);` and nothing else in my app packages whenever I want to use anything from Dancer. That's a bit of a pain, especially if I want to use other modules with conflicting symbols from something else.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1087","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1087/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1087/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1087/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1087","id":46736053,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NjczNjA1Mw==","number":1087,"title":"e-mail addresses in AUTHORS file are not munged","user":{"login":"a-adam","id":5540834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDA4MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5540834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-adam","html_url":"https://github.com/a-adam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-adam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-adam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-adam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-adam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-adam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-adam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-adam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-adam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-adam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-10-24T13:08:54Z","updated_at":"2014-10-25T16:20:11Z","closed_at":"2014-10-25T16:20:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"... which allows for effortless harvesting.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1083","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1083/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1083/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1083/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/1083","id":45586972,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTU4Njk3Mg==","number":1083,"title":"Test fail if Template is not installed","user":{"login":"yanick","id":19954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick","html_url":"https://github.com/yanick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanick/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-10-12T17:23:27Z","updated_at":"2014-10-13T23:26:16Z","closed_at":"2014-10-13T23:26:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"t/01_config/06_stack_trace.t is the culprit.
