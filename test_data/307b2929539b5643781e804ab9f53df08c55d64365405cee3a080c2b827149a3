In these posts, we will try to highlight some of the development that happened in the past week.  For anyone looking to get involved, follow the embedded hyperlinks, search the wealth of information on [github](//github.com/ipfs) or join us on [IRC](//webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) (#ipfs on the Freenode network).\n\nSince this is our first time launching the Weekly, we've included several past weeks. This is partially because we've been refining our process, and wanted to make the first weekly a great one. In the future, they will be released weekly. If you have any feedback about this process in general, let us know [here](//github.com/ipfs/weekly/issues/7). Thanks!\n## December 21\n\nHere are some of the highlights for the [December 21](//github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/76) Sprint:\n### 32c3\n\nNot too much happened during this sprint, because it was the holidays - however, it was also the 32nd CCC. [@whyrusleeping](//github.com/whyrusleeping), [@diasdavid](//github.com/diasdavid), [@lgierth](//github.com/lgierth), [@Dignifiedquire](//github.com/Dignifiedquire) and more of the team were over there in Hamburg.\n\n![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWYaX56pTskFL2UMV2x8ZZAB8xyntPce5bFmY8ugHw47j/32c3.ipfs.2.jpg)\n- [@whyrusleeping](//github.com/whyrusleeping) gave a lightning talk (see above).\n- [@whyrusleeping](//github.com/whyrusleeping) [@diasdavid](//github.com/diasdavid) and [@Dignifiedquire](//github.com/Dignifiedquire) led an install party and live demo.\n- [@MrChrisJ](//github.com/MrChrisJ) led a discussion about his [Full Node project](//news.bitcoin.com/developer-chris-ellis-builds-full-bitcoin-nodes-12-hours/), which includes IPFS.\n- We met lots of our users, and other groups (including [Tahoe-LAFS](https://www.tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs), [tor](https://www.torproject.org/), etc).\n### Updates\n- [**(go-ipfs)**](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) [@whyrusleeping](//github.com/whyrusleeping) and [@diasdavid](//github.com/diasdavid) did amazing work closing around 200 issues as part of the \"Great go-ipfs Issue Party of 2015\".\n- [**(registry-mirror)**](//github.com/ipfs/registry-mirror) npm on IPFS was furthered by [@diasdavid](//github.com/diasdavid) by making it work with 0.4.0. Currently, there are 130,000 modules and it's going strong.\n- [**(go-ipfs)**](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) [@lgierth](//github.com/lgierth) set up namaka and hiiaka (NUC nodes at our table at 32c3). This is pretty cool. CF. [ipfs/infrastructure#142](//github.com/ipfs/infrastructure#142).\n- [**(readme-standard)**](//github.com/RichardLitt/readme-standard) [@RichardLitt](//github.com/RichardLitt) had his own great issue party. He's most proud of breaking ground on the future [readme standard](//github.com/RichardLitt/readme-standard/issues/1) for IPFS.\n- [**(webui)**](//github.com/ipfs/webui) [@Dignifiedquire](//github.com/Dignifiedquire) did some awesome work improving the webui [using webpack](//github.com/ipfs/webui/issues/87).\n- He _also_ managed to release [rust-multiaddr](//github.com/Dignifiedquire/rust-multiaddr) and [rust-multihash](//github.com/Dignifiedquire/rust-multihash), which means more languages now implement the orginal [multihash](//github.com/jbenet/multihash) and [multiaddr](//github.com/jbenet/multiaddr) specs.\n\nFor more updates, see the [sprint issue](//github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/76).\n## December 14\n\nHere are some of the highlights for the [December 14](//github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/74) Sprint:\n### Releases\n- [@whyrusleeping](//github.com/whyrusleeping) shipped [fs-repo-migrations](//github.com/ipfs/fs-repo-migrations)! These are migrations for the filesystem repository of ipfs clients. This tool is written in Go, and developed alongside go-ipfs, but it should work with any repo conforming to the fs-repo specs.\n- [@Dignifiedquire](//github.com/Dignifiedquire) did some great work with [rust-multiaddr](//github.com/Dignifiedquire/rust-multiaddr), which is a Rust implementation of [@jbenet](//github.com/jbenet)'s [multiaddr](//github.com/jbenet/multiaddr).\n### Updates\n- [**(registry-mirror)**](//github.com/ipfs/registry-mirror) [@diasdavid](//github.com/diasdavid) worked on the npm on IPFS project. This involved some new features, moving the mirror to a different server, and making it work better with larger dirs and with 0.4.0.\n- [**(js-ipfs)**](//github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs [@diasdavid](//github.com/diasdavid) pushed some major updates for [js-ipfs](//github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-repo), too.\n\nNot much else to report this week; a lot of people are off to enjoy CCC, and the holidays.\n## December 7th\n\nHere are some highlights of what happened during the [December 7 Sprint](//github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/67) :\n### Releases\n- [@whyrusleeping](//github.com/whyrusleeping)  shipped IPFS version 0.3.10!  It contains [74 new commits](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/compare/v0.3.9...v0.3.10) since the previous version and you can [get it here](//ipfs.io/docs/install/).\n- npm on IPFS!  `registry-mirror` is a new tool that enables distributed discovery of npm modules by fetching and caching the latest state of npm through IPNS.  For more info, see this [blog post](//blog.daviddias.me/2015/12/08/stellar-module-management) by [@diasdavid](//github.com/diasdavid) .\n- [@jbenet](//github.com/jbenet) released a new tool/library called [dnslink](//github.com/jbenet/go-dnslink) that makes it easy to resolve dns links (special TXT records in a domain name that can point to paths, like an IPFS path)\n### Updates\n- [**(infrastructure)**](//github.com/ipfs/infrastructure) On the infrastructure side of things, [@lgierth](//github.com/lgierth) has [bootstrapped](//github.com/ipfs/infrastructure/pull/135) two new storage, each with 17 TB of disk space!\n- [**(api)**](//github.com/ipfs/api) [@RichardLitt](//github.com/RichardLitt) has [reached a draft 1]((//github.com/ipfs/api/pull/13) of the much needed API documentation.\n- [@harlantwood](//github.com/harlantwood) wrote a bit of [nodejs code](//github.com/ipfs/project-repos/pull/11) that spins up a fresh IPFS node, sets it to a known ID, and publishes to IPNS using that node.\n- [**(specs)**](//github.com/ipfs/specs) The new IPFS Linked Data (IPLD) spec is actively being iterated on in the specs repository.  Join the discussion [here!](//github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/37)\n### Active stuff\n- [@robcat](//github.com/robcat) and [@fazo96](//github.com/fazo96) have done great work integrating IPFS with pacman (the package manager for Arch Linux).  They can now install arch packages straight from IPFS!  For more details, see [this active discussion](//github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/84).\n- [@Dignifiedquire](//github.com/Dignifiedquire) has been working on an attractive new distribution page for IPFS, which will be the new landing page to download all things IPFS.  You can see the [latest screenshots here](//github.com/ipfs/distributions/issues/11).\n## Contributors\n\nAcross the entire IPFS GitHub organization, the following people have committed code since December 7th. (We're autogenerating this list using [this tool](//github.com/ipfs/weekly/pull/5), so please let us know if your name isn't here.) In the future, we will also include people who comment, as they are also super important; bear with us while we develop that technology.\n- [@alexmingoia](//github.com/alexmingoia) (Alex Mingoia)\n- [@chriscool](//github.com/chriscool) (Christian Couder)\n- [@diasdavid](//github.com/diasdavid) (David Dias)\n- [@digital-dreamer](//github.com/digital-dreamer)\n- [@Dignifiedquire](//github.com/Dignifiedquire) (Friedel Ziegelmayer)\n- [@djdv](//github.com/djdv) (Dominic Della Valle)\n- [@fazo96](//github.com/fazo96) (Enrico Fasoli)\n- [@greenkeeperio-bot](//github.com/greenkeeperio-bot)\n- [@harlantwood](//github.com/harlantwood) (Harlan T Wood)\n- [@hcs64](//github.com/hcs64) (Adam Gashlin)\n- [@ianopolous](//github.com/ianopolous) (Ian Preston)\n- [@ivilata](//github.com/ivilata) (Ivan Vilata-i-Balaguer)\n- [@jbenet](//github.com/jbenet) (Juan Benet)\n- [@jedahan](//github.com/jedahan) (Jonathan Dahan)\n- [@Kubuxu](//github.com/Kubuxu) (Jakub Sztandera)\n- [@kyledrake](//github.com/kyledrake) (Kyle Drake)\n- [@lgierth](//github.com/lgierth) (Lars Gierth)\n- [@NeoTeo](//github.com/NeoTeo) (Teo Sartori)\n- [@ralphtheninja](//github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n- [@ReadmeCritic](//github.com/ReadmeCritic)\n- [@rht](//github.com/rht)\n- [@RichardLitt](//github.com/RichardLitt) (Richard Littauer)\n- [@travisperson](//github.com/travisperson) (Travis Person)\n- [@wasserfuhr](//github.com/wasserfuhr) (RainerWasserfuhr)\n- [@whyrusleeping](//github.com/whyrusleeping) (Jeromy Johnson)\n- [@zignig](//github.com/zignig) (Simon Kirkby)\n\nThanks, and see you next week!\n- Richard Littauer and Andrew Chin\n\n[_Send us feedback about the Weekly_](//github.com/ipfs/weekly/issues/7)\n# \n# IPFS Weekly #2\n\n[IPFS](//ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities, aiming to make the web faster, safer, and more open. In these posts, we highlight some of the development that has happened in the past week. For anyone looking to get involved, follow the embedded hyperlinks, search the wealth of information on [GitHub](//github.com/ipfs) or join us on [IRC](//webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) (#ipfs on the Freenode network).\n\nHere are some of the highlights for the [January 5th](//github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/77) Sprint:\n## Updates\n- [**(specs)**](//github.com/ipfs/specs) There was much debate in the [IPLD spec](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/37) about pathing notation. [@mildred](//github.com/mildred) in particular did a lot of good work.\n- [**(go-ipfs)**](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) The IPFS Docker image is now tested automatically on Travis, thanks to [@ChristianKniep](//github.com/ChristianKniep), [@whyrusleeping](//github.com/whyrusleeping), and [@chriscool](//github.com/chriscool). For more, see the [go-ipfs#2064](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/2064) pull request.\n- [**(js-ipfs)**](//github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) Now you can do `npm i -g js-ipfs` and use jsipfs (the javascript impl of IPFS) with bootstrap + id + version commands, fully compatible with the go-ipfs repo, thanks to [@diasdavid](//github.com/diasdavid)!\n- [**(project-repos)**](//github.com/ipfs/project-repos) A very cool [organization-wide dashboard](http://project-repos.ipfs.io/) that provides a status overview of all the IPFS repos was launched.  By [@harlantwood](//github.com/harlantwood).\n- [**(community)**](//github.com/ipfs/community) [@RichardLitt](//github.com/RichardLitt) merged the pull request for [JavaScript guidelines](//github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/js-contribution-guidelines.md) for IPFS repos. This is a major step towards standard JavaScript repositories within IPFS.\n- [**(community)**](//github.com/ipfs/community#meetups) [@NeoTeo](//github.com/NeoTeo), [@whyrusleeping](//github.com/whyrusleeping), and [@diasdavid](//github.com/diasdavid) hosted a small meetup in Copenhagen!  Eight people in total showed up for an intro to IPFS, a Q&A session, and some good conversation!\n## Work in Progress\n- [**(distributions)**](//github.com/distributions) [@Dignifiedquire](//github.com/Dignifiedquire) further developed the distributions page.  [Click here](http://v04x.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZyvWokPYGg6DrjE6o2V7qhThzZQZ8QCWqdd2U3S75HXC/index.html) for a preview!\n- [**(go-ipfs)**](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) [@lgierth](//github.com/lgierth) continued the work towards the dev040 migration.  Notably we have two new gateways to aid in the transition:   [http://v04x.ipfs.io](http://v04x.ipfs.io) and [http://v03x.ipfs.io](http://v03x.ipfs.io)\n- [**(archives)**](//github.com/ipfs/archives/) [@Dignifiedquire](//github.com/Dignifiedquire) has added to IPFS a dump of the Stackexchange archives!  Details are [in the archives repo](//github.com/ipfs/archives/issues/50). We are always looking for more help with archiving important datasets, so feel free to join us in the [archives repo](//github.com/ipfs/archives/)!\n## Contributors\n\nAcross the entire IPFS GitHub organization, the following people have committed code since January 4th.

Really liked it. \r\n\r\n1. I find behaviour of emit and .withhandler confusing. Documentation says\r\n`Instead of updating state locally, you can choose to emit() a message to the parent component, telling it how to update the model for the inner component` on this [page](http://www.react4s.org/). Also if I see emit documentation in IntelliJ I find  - \r\n\r\n`/** Emit a message of type M, which can be handled by a parent component by using .withHandler(...). */\r\n    var emit : M => Unit = { _ => }`\r\n\r\nThis understanding  and code implemented in [Tree editor example](https://github.com/Ahnfelt/react4s-samples/tree/master/src/main/scala/com/github/ahnfelt/react4s/samples/treeeditor) is not aligned. TreeNodeComponent emits event in renderButton method and is handled in same component (NOT parent component) in renderTodoList. Can you please explain this behaviour?\r\n\r\n2. Library [documentation](http://www.react4s.org/) says `React4s has an Elm/Redux-like emit() system` . Does that mean it provide redux like store (single place to store state) and any component (not only parent component) can listen to state
