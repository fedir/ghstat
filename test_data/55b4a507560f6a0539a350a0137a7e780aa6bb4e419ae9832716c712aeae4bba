A CMS that would associate the expected features of a CMS with our custom logic would be so awesome :)\r\n\r\nSo, I attempted to test it, but I met some troubles… :-(\r\n\r\nI needed to adapt your setup.md. ( Because, at the beginning, I just had a « white screen » ). If you want, I can make a PR :)\r\nhttps://github.com/Yoann-TYT/victoire/commit/7155aaca007804d9f96f0f4db28cffbc476dd99c\r\n\r\nFirst trouble, a javascript error says that this.drop is a null element… \r\n`\r\n,{key:\"dropAnchors\",get:function(){return Array.prototype.slice.call(this.drop.querySelectorAll(\"a\"))}\r\n`\r\n\r\nSo, a lot of javascript buttons doesn’t work.\r\n\r\nSome errors on Media Library as : \r\n\r\n> Expected argument of type \"string\", \"Victoire\\Bundle\\MediaBundle\\Form\\RemoteSlide\\RemoteSlideType\" given\r\nOr …. \r\n> The \"replace\" filter expects an array or \"Traversable\" as replace values, got \"string\".\r\n\r\nSo, can you tell me what version of Victoire should I use to test your CMS ? :)\r\n\r\nThis is my composer info\r\n\r\nI use PHP 7.1.3 and its
