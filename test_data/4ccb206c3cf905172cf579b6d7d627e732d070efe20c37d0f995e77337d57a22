same way we have a `--skip-view` option:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--[no-]skip-view # Skip view and template, default: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was wondering if it could be a good idea to add a `--skip-route` option to the action generator:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--[no-]skip-route # Skip route, default: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe it's just me. Here is how I plan my features:\r\n\r\n- First, I build the route and deduce a possible action\r\n- I directly write it down in the routes file\r\n- Then, I generate the action\r\n- Which \"forces\" me to go back to the routes file to remove the automatically generated route\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hanami/hanami/issues/913","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hanami/hanami","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hanami/hanami/issues/913/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hanami/hanami/issues/913/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hanami/hanami/issues/913/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hanami/hanami/issues/913","id":305431142,"number":913,"title":"Can Hanami::Env read local dotenv files?","user":{"login":"mrdShinse","id":7848879,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7848879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdShinse","html_url":"https://github.com/mrdShinse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdShinse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdShinse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdShinse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdShinse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdShinse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdShinse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdShinse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdShinse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdShinse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":51404913,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hanami/hanami/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mereghost","id":10281,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost","html_url":"https://github.com/mereghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mereghost","id":10281,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost","html_url":"https://github.com/mereghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mereghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-03-15T06:35:47Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T00:22:40Z","closed_at":"2018-03-22T00:22:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nCan Hanami::Env read local dotenv files?

[reported](https://gitter.im/hanami/chat?at=5a89d875888332ee3a9dc491) that when generating non-RESTful (resourceful) routes like:\r\n```\r\nhanami generate action web 'session#sign_out'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting route is unexpected:\r\n```ruby\r\n          GET, HEAD  /session                       Web::Controllers::Session::SignOut\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should consider changing this so that when non-RESTful routes are generated, the path joins the controller name and the action name, with a slash, rather than just using the controller name. So in this case, the generated path would be `/session/sign_out`.\r\n\r\n(This isn't a great example, since `sign_out` can, and should, be a resourceful route to `Sessions::Destroy` but, in general, there are some times when people might need to generate non-resourceful routes, and we should generate a path that's not surprising.)\r\n\r\nI don't see this as a high priority, since we encourage people to use resourceful routes whenever possible, but I think it'd be a nice enhancement.
