With bare Clack everything works just fine. I am using SBCL 1.3.5 at the moment. \n\nOther clients, such as the iOS client used by the Titanium app compiled for iOS, work just fine with Lucerne.\n\nThe Android Ti client works just fine with node.js, Clack, plain Hunchentoot, Nginx, and Apache. Of all the combinations I’ve tried so far, only with the combination Lucerne on top of Clack using Hunchentoot, causes problems, on this particular client.\n\nWhen Lucerne-app is proxied through nginx we get a 499 error indicating the client has disconnected prematurely.\n\nThis is a barebones client that exhibits the problem:\n\n```\nfunction sendRequest(e) {\n    console.log('http request started');\n    var httpClient = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({\n        onload : function(){\n            console.log('Data '+this.responseText);\n            alert ('success!');\n        },\n        onerror: function(error){\n            console.log('Error '+ this.responseText+' status '+this.status);\n            alert('fail!\\n');\n        }\n    });\n    httpClient.setTimeout(4*1000); \n    httpClient.open('GET','http://192.168.69.185:8003/');\n    httpClient.send();\n}\n\n$.index.open();\n```\n\nThe Lucerne app is just the generator skeleton app with a simplified / route:\n\n```\n@route app “/“\n(defview index ()\n  (respond “Hello, Lucerne!” :type “text/plain”))\n\n```\n\nClack was tested with the very minimal:\n\n`(clackup (lambda (env) '(200 (:content-type “text/plain”) (“Hello, Clack!”))))\n`\nI've attached the packet captures from the above tests, showing the normal and anomalous behaviour in [tihttclient-test-pcapng.tar.gz](https://github.com/eudoxia0/lucerne/files/248922/tihttclient-test-pcapng.tar.gz)\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eudoxia0/lucerne/issues/11","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eudoxia0/lucerne","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eudoxia0/lucerne/issues/11/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eudoxia0/lucerne/issues/11/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eudoxia0/lucerne/issues/11/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eudoxia0/lucerne/issues/11","id":98617032,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5ODYxNzAzMg==","number":11,"title":"Any contribs you suggest to contribute?","user":{"login":"macdavid313","id":3747082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDcwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3747082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/macdavid313","html_url":"https://github.com/macdavid313","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macdavid313/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macdavid313/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macdavid313/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macdavid313/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macdavid313/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macdavid313/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macdavid313/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macdavid313/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macdavid313/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-08-02T15:35:59Z","updated_at":"2015-08-05T21:36:59Z","closed_at":"2015-08-03T05:25:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any contribs you suggest to contribute?
