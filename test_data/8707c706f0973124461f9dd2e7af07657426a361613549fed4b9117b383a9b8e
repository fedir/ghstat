I have a small API server built using Webmachine that is responding to REST clients. Since webmachine is built upon mochiweb, filing the issue here. The test clients are written in erlang using eunit and the source can be found at the link below. I have already vetted the fact that its not an inets/httpc issue (see link to erlang-questions below).\n\nThe issue:\nhttpc by default uses HTTP/1.1 to open connections with the server. Within the same connection I do 2 sequential GET requests and in another connection 2 sequential POST requests. The connection with the POST requests fails 99.99% of the time while the GET requests always succeed. After trying different options, turns out using HTTP/1.0 instead of HTTP/1.1 for the POST connections makes it work. Based on the erlang-questions thread, the client is trying to re-use the same connection while the server has closed it which results in **error:{badmatch,{error,socket_closed_remotely}}. Adding debug printfs produced a big enough delay in the client to catch the server's closing of the connection.\n\nExpected: \nSince its HTTP/1.1, mochiweb should not be closing the connection after each request. Passing in \"Connection: keep-alive\" header didn't help either.\n\nLink to erlang-questions \n- discussion thread: http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2015-January/082654.html\n- most important message with the workaround: http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2015-January/082656.html\n\nLink to test source & output: http://pastebin.com/9DFzxLps\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mochi/mochiweb/issues/143","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mochi/mochiweb","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mochi/mochiweb/issues/143/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mochi/mochiweb/issues/143/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mochi/mochiweb/issues/143/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb/issues/143","id":53974136,"number":143,"title":"how is used acceptor_pool_size with max","user":{"login":"benoitc","id":14498,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc","html_url":"https://github.com/benoitc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-01-10T22:41:22Z","updated_at":"2015-01-12T14:07:42Z","closed_at":"2015-01-10T22:53:08Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi,\n\nI am not sure to understand the difference between acceptor_pool_size and max.
