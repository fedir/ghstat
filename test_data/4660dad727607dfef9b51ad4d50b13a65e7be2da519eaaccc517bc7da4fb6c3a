Description\r\n\r\nEditor experiences weird behavior in the backend after publishing changes.\r\nThe backend become unresponsive to some click, and he has to reload the interface in order to continue editing.\r\n\r\nI found that the bug is caused by a JS error `Empty or non existent \"message\" passed to the addFlashMessage reducer. Please specify a string containing your desired message.` thrown by `Neos.Neos.Ui/packages/neos-ui-redux-store/src/UI/FlashMessages/index.ts:77`.\r\nThe code is trying to display a flash message, but the message is `null`.\r\nI check what flash message should be displayed when publishing, and found the label `changesApplied` of `Neos.Neos.Ui:Main.xlf`.\r\nThis label exists only in EN and DE, and the editor set his language to FR.\r\nSetting the editor's language to EN makes the error disappear and the flashMessage is displayed.\r\n\r\nSo either the translation fallback is not working, either the UI is too strict when displaying an untranslated flash message.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set the user's language preference to something different that EN or DE\r\n2. Open the browser JS console\r\n3. Edit a node property and publish it\r\n4. A JS error is thrown and is visible in the browser console\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI should see the flash message saying \"The change has bee published\" in the user language (or in the fallback language)\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nI see no flash message and there is a JS error.\r\n\r\n### Affected Versions\r\n\r\nNeos:  5.3.0\r\n\r\nFlow: 6.3.1\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/3146","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/3146/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/3146/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/3146/events","html_url":"https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/3146","id":730279549,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzAyNzk1NDk=","number":3146,"title":"You can't install Neos with composer 2.0","user":{"login":"Blumen-topf","id":73471148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDcxMTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/73471148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blumen-topf","html_url":"https://github.com/Blumen-topf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blumen-topf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blumen-topf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blumen-topf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blumen-topf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blumen-topf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blumen-topf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blumen-topf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blumen-topf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blumen-topf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":446789101,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NDY3ODkxMDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"b60205","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1077796360,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDc3Nzk2MzYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"411e2f","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kdambekalns","id":95873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/95873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns","html_url":"https://github.com/kdambekalns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kdambekalns","id":95873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/95873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns","html_url":"https://github.com/kdambekalns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdambekalns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2020-10-27T09:38:21Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T07:16:52Z","closed_at":"2020-10-29T16:48:51Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!--\r\nIf you are reporting a new issue, make sure that we do not have any duplicates\r\nalready open.

The dimensions are `{\"language\":\"de\"}` for the first node and `{\"language\":\"en\"}` for the second. The order of the nodes is relevant.\r\n* `$workspaces` An array containing only the live workspace.\r\n* `$dimensions` An array of the form `{\"language\": \"en\"}`\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIn the final returned array `$reducedNodes` only the second node should be returned, since this node matches the requested dimensions from `$dimensions`.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe first node is returned.\r\n\r\n#### Problem analysis\r\n\r\nIn the first iteration of the `$nodes` loop the `de` node will be iterated. Since both, the node dimensions and `$dimensions` contain `language` the inner loop is processed, see https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/blob/2516e40258bc9f21fe8a466bf867ab0c7682e7a8/Neos.ContentRepository/Classes/Domain/Repository/NodeDataRepository.php#L1320.  \r\nThe `array_search` will fail, because `de` is not found in `$dimensions` and thus `$position` is false.\r\nIn line https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/blob/2516e40258bc9f21fe8a466bf867ab0c7682e7a8/Neos.ContentRepository/Classes/Domain/Repository/NodeDataRepository.php#L1334 the `$minimalDimensionPositionsByIdentifier` is empty since this is the first iteration, thus the condition is true and the node is added to `$reducedNodes`.\r\n\r\nIn the second iteration of the `$nodes` loop the `en` node is used. Again, the `language` dimension matches and thus `array_search` will find a valid position in `$dimension` which results in `$position` having the integer value `0`. Now the second condition on line 1334 is evaluated where `$dimensionPositions < $minimalDimensionPositionsByIdentifier[$identifier]` is false. So the node is ignored.\r\nAs an example, the comparision is done for the following two arrays:\r\n```\r\n$dimensionPositions = [\r\n    \"language\": 0,\r\n    \"0\": 1\r\n];\r\n$minimalDimensionPositionsByIdentifier[$identifier] = [\r\n    \"language\": false,\r\n    \"0\": 1\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe very reason this fails, is because `0 < false` is false.\r\n\r\n#### Possible solution\r\n\r\nIn case `array_search` doesn't find the dimension value, this node should be pushed back to the very end of the `$dimensionPositions[$dimensionName]` array, such that further `min()` calls will prefer matching nodes given a set of nodes and dimensionValues in a specific order.\r\n\r\nThe solution could be to change\r\n```\r\n$position = array_search($nodeDimensionValue, $dimensionValues);\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\n$position = array_search($nodeDimensionValue, $dimensionValues);\r\nif($position === false){\r\n    $position = PHP_INT_MAX;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Sidenote optimization\r\n\r\nThe call to `array_map` for the workspaces is run for every node, but does not depend on the current `$node`. So `array_map` can be moved before the `foreach ($nodes as $node) {` loop.\r\n\r\nNeos: 4.3.3\r\n\r\nFlow: 5.3.2","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/2045","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/2045/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/2045/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/2045/events","html_url":"https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/2045","id":318392743,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTgzOTI3NDM=","number":2045,"title":"Include also the brand icons from FontAwesome 5","user":{"login":"jonnitto","id":4510166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTAxNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4510166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnitto","html_url":"https://github.com/jonnitto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnitto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnitto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnitto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnitto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnitto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnitto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnitto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnitto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnitto/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":274940449,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ5NDA0NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/labels/T:%20UX","name":"T: UX","color":"009800","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-27T12:33:58Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T13:04:45Z","closed_at":"2020-10-28T13:04:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"With the introduction of FontAwesome 5, many new icons were added.

Description\r\n\r\nSometimes you are using language labels with arguments and it can happen that you need a singular and plural of a word depending on the argument. For instance for the amout of errors.\r\n\r\nXLIFF supports that and the Flow translator as well. But when you want to use that labels in the JS part of the neos-ui you have no possibility to get the plural. You always get the singular if this is the first value in the group.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<group id=\"validationErrorTooltip\" restype=\"x-gettext-plurals\">\r\n    <trans-unit id=\"validationErrorTooltip[0]\" xml:space=\"preserve\">\r\n        <source>{tabName} – {amountOfErrors} validation issue</source>\r\n    </trans-unit>\r\n    <trans-unit id=\"validationErrorTooltip[1]\" xml:space=\"preserve\">\r\n        <source>{tabName} – {amountOfErrors} validation issues</source>\r\n    </trans-unit>\r\n</group>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst notificationTooltipLabelPieces = i18nRegistry.translate(\r\n    'validationErrorTooltip',\r\n    '',\r\n    {\r\n        tabName: tabLabel,\r\n        amountOfErrors: number\r\n    },\r\n    'Neos.Neos.Ui'\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in this case the label will be in the UI always `Our Tab – 2 validation issue` instead of `Our Tab – 2 validation issues`.\r\n\r\nWould like to change that and have the plural also in the UI. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create group labels like in the description\r\n2. use the label with i18nRegistry.translate\r\n3. Label will be always the first label in the group\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nLabel should be `Our Tab – 2 validation issues` when using error number higher than one.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nLabel is singular `Our Tab – 2 validation issue`\r\n\r\n### Affected Versions\r\n\r\nNeos: all\r\n\r\nUI: all since ever as the code comes from the old Emberjs

Description\r\n\r\nAfter Upgrading from Neos 5.1 to 5.2 rendering is broken for every content element where a Neos.Neos:ContentCollection is used and applied as prop.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create the following content element with a ContentCollection as childNode:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprototype(My.Package:Content.Section) < prototype(Neos.Neos:ContentComponent) {\r\n\ttest = ${q(node).property('title')}\r\n\tcontent = Neos.Neos:ContentCollection {\r\n\t\tnodePath = 'content'\r\n\t}\r\n\trenderer = Neos.Fusion:Component {\r\n\t\t@apply.props = ${props}\r\n\t\trenderer = afx`\r\n\t\t\t<div>{props.content}</div>\r\n\t\t`\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.
