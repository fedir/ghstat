From the docs, I would have expected `@preact/compat` to fix this out of the box, but it doesn't seem to work.\r\n\r\nI suspect that there's an issue with how `preact-render-to-string` detects styles when using the `className` prop (which MUI uses internally). Perhaps there's an issue with how `preact-render-to-string` is configured that makes it fail to parse `className` props correctly? In any case, this unfortunately means that it seems like it's impossible to use existing third-party libraries that aren't already Preact compatible.\r\n\r\nI can get styles to apply correctly if there's any re-render on the component (which is why I suspect `preact-render-to-string`), but on initial page load none of the HTML elements have classes applied.\r\n\r\nWeirdly, if I add a `class` prop to one of the MUI components, the _base_ styles are applied fine, but any class names I've added to the `class` prop aren't applied.\r\n\r\nI've made a minimal repro here which you can clone: https://github.com/colophonemes/preact-next-mui-test\r\n\r\nThe site is also running on Vercel here for a live demo: https://next-preact-test.vercel.app/\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any pointers you're able to give!","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/nextjs-preact-demo/issues/23","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/nextjs-preact-demo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/nextjs-preact-demo/issues/23/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/nextjs-preact-demo/issues/23/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developit/nextjs-preact-demo/issues/23/events","html_url":"https://github.com/developit/nextjs-preact-demo/issues/23","id":717098784,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MTcwOTg3ODQ=","number":23,"title":"Prerendered pages does not work in a Preact/Next.js site on Vercel","user":{"login":"tomsoderlund","id":1368668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjg2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1368668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsoderlund","html_url":"https://github.com/tomsoderlund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsoderlund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsoderlund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsoderlund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsoderlund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsoderlund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsoderlund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsoderlund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsoderlund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsoderlund/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-10-08T07:31:20Z","updated_at":"2020-10-26T11:02:47Z","closed_at":"2020-10-26T11:02:47Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I have a simple web app based on https://github.com/developit/nextjs-preact-demo\r\n\r\nHowever, prerendering doesn't work: the `/namegenerator` route contains the HTML from the start page.

got feedback from aganov:\r\n>@luc-github Do you have any plans for the web ui. My proposal is to use webpack for the build process and then we can use https://github.com/developit/preact (3kb) or https://github.com/choojs/choo (4kb) to organise the UI into components and bring some reactivity. Also we can replace glyph icons with some svg based icons like https://feathericons.com/ for example...

I have couple of boilerplate projects which show how to use https://github.com/capaj/systemjs-hot-reloader with different frameworks.\nI wanted to get one for preact as well, but that proved harder than it should be.\nFirst reason was your custom jsx which I think I can solve with @guybedford but the other one which you might help me with was something that bit me when I rerender a preact app.\n\nI have this very simple hello world app: https://github.com/capaj/jspm-preact/blob/master/public/app.js#L13\n\nAll it does is render Hello world. Now when render is called second time(because we reloaded some module and want to refresh the app) it actually appends another Hello world into my 'app' div element. I haven't had any such behaviour with react. React `render()` always deterministically returns same DOM, overwriting the current elements.\n\nDo you have any reason that this is how preact render method behaves? If not, could you please align the behaviour with react? Then I could drop this little hack: https://github.com/capaj/jspm-preact/blob/master/public/app.js#L16\n\nThanks for consideration.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/preactjs/preact/issues/758","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/preactjs/preact","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/preactjs/preact/issues/758/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/preactjs/preact/issues/758/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/preactjs/preact/issues/758/events","html_url":"https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/758","id":243041511,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNDMwNDE1MTE=","number":758,"title":"Provide externs to enable advanced compilation for closure compiler.","user":{"login":"samccone","id":883126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/883126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samccone","html_url":"https://github.com/samccone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samccone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samccone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samccone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samccone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samccone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samccone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samccone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samccone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samccone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":491773363,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE3NzMzNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/preactjs/preact/labels/builds","name":"builds","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":258981561,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTg5ODE1NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/preactjs/preact/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":null},{"id":564247222,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NjQyNDcyMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/preactjs/preact/labels/types","name":"types","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2017-07-14T16:09:03Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T16:18:11Z","closed_at":"2019-08-12T07:46:01Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"building off of #564...
