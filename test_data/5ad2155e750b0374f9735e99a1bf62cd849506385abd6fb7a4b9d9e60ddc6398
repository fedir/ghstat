Add following application.yml\r\n```\r\n---\r\ngrails:\r\n    gorm:\r\n        multiTenancy:\r\n                mode: DATABASE\r\n                tenantResolverClass: org.grails.datastore.mapping.multitenancy.web.SessionTenantResolver\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create a Domain file (doesn't matter if doesn't have fields\r\n```\r\nclass TestDomain {\r\n\r\n    static constraints = {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Create specification for spock\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass TestSpec extends Specification implements DomainUnitTest<Test> {\r\n\r\n    def setup() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    def cleanup() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void \"test something\"() {\r\n        expect:\"fix me\"\r\n            true == true\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n4.

downloaded, Grails 3.3.2 stylesheets main.css and grails.css use identical colors for links and highlighted background in the index GSP view. Any links in the index view become invisible.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a minor issue, still an undesirable gotcha for newcomers.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Download test app from https://github.com/namgang/grails332-stylesheet-issue\r\n2. Build it with Grails 3.3.2, run it.\r\n3. The app has two domains, Ping and Pong. At startup it populates the database with one Ping having a couple of Pongs. The initial view is an index view of Ping.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nYou see a list containing just one Ping having a number Pongs. Move your pointer there. Out of the box the contents should be readable regardless if the row is highlighted or not.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen you move the pointer there contents disappear because the font color is identical to the (highlight) background color.\r\n\r\n### Environment Information\r\n\r\n- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS\r\n- **Grails Version:** 3.3.2\r\n- **JDK Version:** Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_151-b12)\r\n- **Container Version (If Applicable):** n/a\r\n\r\n### Example Application\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/namgang/grails332-stylesheet-issue\r\n\r\n### Source pointers\r\n\r\nIn a fresh Grails 3.3.2 download the problem lines are:\r\n./grails-app/assets/stylesheets/main.css lines 448..450\r\n./grails-app/assets/stylesheets/grails.css lines 383..391\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the highlighting color is too garish. Something more washed-out like #FEE4B5 would do (main.css:449). Some contrasting colors (for grails.css:384,389) are #2B6E65 (green) or 9E7C3E (brown). But then someone is doing an overall color scheme I guess.\r\n\r\nSorry, haven't been able to locate the project of the sources...","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grails/grails-core/issues/10909","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grails/grails-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grails/grails-core/issues/10909/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grails/grails-core/issues/10909/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grails/grails-core/issues/10909/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/10909","id":290532877,"number":10909,"title":"[Issue]: Databinding array items from json request","user":{"login":"tkvw","id":621098,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/621098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkvw","html_url":"https://github.com/tkvw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkvw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkvw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkvw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkvw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkvw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkvw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkvw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkvw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkvw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":215816911,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grails/grails-core/labels/Workaround%20Available","name":"Workaround Available","color":"207de5","default":false},{"id":215874771,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grails/grails-core/labels/in%20progress","name":"in progress","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sdelamo","id":864788,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/864788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo","html_url":"https://github.com/sdelamo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sdelamo","id":864788,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/864788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo","html_url":"https://github.com/sdelamo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdelamo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-01-22T16:40:08Z","updated_at":"2018-01-30T10:54:25Z","closed_at":"2018-01-30T10:54:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Example project (core branch): \r\nhttps://github.com/tkvw/issue-java8-localtime/tree/core\r\n\r\nThis fails because the collection is not cleared when a new array is assigned.
