With this line the mediasource will be set to the record or the default mediasource on the page load and not only with a listener on the 'mediasource' field.\r\n\r\n```,source: config.record.source != null ? config.record.source : MODx.config.default_media_source```\r\n\r\nThis can be fix with this pull request: https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/13646\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nAll MODX versions","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13749","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13749/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13749/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13749/events","html_url":"https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/issues/13749","id":294211713,"number":13749,"title":"Italian Translations","user":{"login":"digitalplayer-steemit","id":36071482,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/36071482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalplayer-steemit","html_url":"https://github.com/digitalplayer-steemit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalplayer-steemit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalplayer-steemit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalplayer-steemit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalplayer-steemit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalplayer-steemit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalplayer-steemit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalplayer-steemit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalplayer-steemit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalplayer-steemit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-02-04T16:54:54Z","updated_at":"2018-02-04T17:24:31Z","closed_at":"2018-02-04T16:58:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello\r\n\r\nMy name is Michael Asumcinei and I would like to contribute with Italian translations.\r\n\r\nI can do that only using Github as I am an adopter of Utopian.io project to reward open source software.\r\n\r\nJust let me know if you are interested and I will be there for it\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nMichael Asumcinei\r\nsteemit.com/@digitalplayer","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13748","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13748/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13748/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13748/events","html_url":"https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/issues/13748","id":294189900,"number":13748,"title":"undefined index -

Happy to work on this and submit a PR but could use some help from someone who knows the parser class, and maybe the chunk class (filter class?) really, really well. I've played around with these files a decent amount but the surprising nature of this bug has me puzzled where to look.\r\n\r\n### Step to reproduce\r\nTemplate, Resource, and Chunk code is at this gist:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/sepiariver/77651d2611cacfc461d980470ed9ff38\r\n\r\n### Observed behavior\r\n**Scenario 1**\r\nThe output of the Resource content (without the Template wrapper), from that setup is:\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"outer\">\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"test nested\">\r\n    <div class=\"inner\">\r\n    0\r\n    <div class=\"bar\">my string.</div>\r\n    <div class=\"empty\"></div>\r\n    </div>  \r\n    </div> \r\n\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nSee: view-source:https://c0340.paas3.tx.modxcloud.com/index.php?id=1\r\n\r\nNOTE: the wrapper for `[[+foo]]` is missing but the value is there. That's an implementation bug, using `:notempty` instead of :is:then:else. \r\n\r\n**Scenario 2**\r\nIf you change the `$testInner` Chunk to:\r\n```\r\n    <div class=\"inner\">\r\n        [[+foo:notempty=`<div class=\"foo\">[[+foo]]</div>`]]\r\n        [[+bar:is=``:then=``:else=`<div class=\"bar\">[[+bar]]</div>`]]\r\n        [[+emptyProp:empty=`<div class=\"empty\">[[+emptyProp]]</div>`]]\r\n        [[+unsetProp:notempty=`<div class=\"unset\">[[+unsetProp]]</div>`]]\r\n    </div>\r\n```\r\nNOTE the unsetProp is not commented out anymore.\r\nThe output of the Resource content (without the Template wrapper) now is:\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"outer\">\r\n \r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nSee: See: view-source:https://c0339.paas3.tx.modxcloud.com/index.php?id=1\r\nEverything's gone!!\r\n\r\nThe key factors seem to be:\r\n1. There's an unset placeholder in the inner Chunk. Set but empty placeholders don't cause the issue.\r\n2. The unset placeholder has an output filter applied.\r\n3. THIS IS THE WEIRDEST. Only if the options passed to the output filter contain a `=` character, not only is the output of the inner Chunk blown away, but the property string on the outer Chunk also becomes empty. The quirky behaviour is scoped to that property on the outer Chunk. The rest of the Chunk/Resource rendering proceeds normally. No errors appear in the MODX log and no error file is generated in the document root.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nScenario 1\r\nIf the `:notempty` filter condition is not met, should it render the value of the placeholder? Or nothing? The expected behaviour is nothing, but in the case of `(int) 0` it will show a string \"0\". In all other cases of `empty()` being empty, it will render nothing.\r\n\r\nScenario 2\r\nThe _entire property string_ for the property \"testProp\" on the Chunk \"testOuter\" called in the Resource, disappears! I don't think anyone intended for this to happen...did they? So the expected behaviour is that the rest of the property string remains intact while the conditional is evaluated and the output rendered for that placeholder based on the results.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nFresh install on MODX Cloud, no Extras. Reproducible on 2.6.1 and 2.5.8. Also reproduced locally.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13742","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13742/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13742/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13742/events","html_url":"https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/issues/13742","id":291496937,"number":13742,"title":"Cannot regenerate session id - session is not active","user":{"login":"Erdem-Ozyalcin","id":26109190,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/26109190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Erdem-Ozyalcin","html_url":"https://github.com/Erdem-Ozyalcin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Erdem-Ozyalcin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Erdem-Ozyalcin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Erdem-Ozyalcin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Erdem-Ozyalcin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Erdem-Ozyalcin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Erdem-Ozyalcin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Erdem-Ozyalcin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Erdem-Ozyalcin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Erdem-Ozyalcin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-01-25T09:07:42Z","updated_at":"2018-01-29T23:31:51Z","closed_at":"2018-01-29T23:31:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When i login for a front end page (not for mgr) i get this error message in my error log.\r\n[2018-01-25 10:00:43] (ERROR @ /paas/c0176/www/core/model/modx/moduser.class.php : 355) PHP warning: session_regenerate_id(): Cannot regenerate session id - session is not active\r\n\r\nWhat can this mean?\r\n\r\nI am using modxcloud modx 2.6.1 and php 7.1\r\nand for to login pluggin i use login 1.9.4\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13741","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13741/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13741/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/issues/13741/events","html_url":"https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/issues/13741","id":291278048,"number":13741,"title":"regClientScript and regClientHTMLBlock do nothing","user":{"login":"c0mat0se","id":10890005,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10890005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0mat0se","html_url":"https://github.com/c0mat0se","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0mat0se/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0mat0se/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0mat0se/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0mat0se/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0mat0se/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0mat0se/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0mat0se/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0mat0se/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0mat0se/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2018-01-24T16:42:09Z","updated_at":"2018-01-24T21:31:52Z","closed_at":"2018-01-24T21:26:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Summary\r\nWhen using `regClientScript` or `regClientHTMLBlock` within a plugin, they do not render.
