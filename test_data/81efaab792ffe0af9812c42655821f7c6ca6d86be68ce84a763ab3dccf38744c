use this issue tracker for bugs and feature requests only. In case you need support please use one of\r\nYii communities listed at https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/wiki/communities\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nDoesn't work session in PostgreSQL 12.2\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nAuthorization via session DB\r\n\r\nQuite a strange bug, because it is simple, but however my problem is not solved... I updated the framework to 2.0.38 and switched to php74. After updating the backend application that stores sessions in files is working. But the frontend application which stores sessions in the database, refuses. Can't figure out why ... Did even direct authentication:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nphp public function actionLogin()\r\n{\r\n    $user = User::findOne(261);\r\n    Yii::$app->user->login($user,1000*60*60*24);\r\n    \r\n    if (!Yii::$app->user->isGuest) {\r\n        return $this->redirect('index');\r\n        ///return $this->redirect(Yii::$app->homeUrl);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```php\r\nphp public function actionIndex()\r\n{\r\n    var_dump(123);\r\n    var_dump(Yii::$app->user->identity);\r\n    die();\r\n    \r\n    return $this->actionLogin();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gets to the page. This means that he will authorize it for 1 second. And in Index it already disappears after the request. In this case, sessions in the database are created and they are not expired.\r\n\r\nConfig for session component\r\n\r\n```php\r\n'session' => [\r\n    'class' => 'yii\\web\\DbSession',\r\n    'timeout' => intval(@$params['sessionTimeout']) ?: 180 * 60, // 180 мин\r\n    'sessionTable' => '{{%auth_session}}',\r\n    'writeCallback' => function ($session) {\r\n        $loginTime = null;\r\n        if (!Yii::$app->user->isGuest) {\r\n            $loginTime = Yii::$app->user->identity->getLastLogin();\r\n        }\r\n        return [\r\n            'user_id' => Yii::$app->user->id ?: 0,\r\n            'ip' => Yii::$app->request->userIP,\r\n            'login_time' => $loginTime,\r\n        ];\r\n    }\r\n], \r\n```\r\n\r\n[This](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/d341bf02b4a4215e58e1315a6cbee1dca1924cbb/framework/web/DbSession.php) file works.
