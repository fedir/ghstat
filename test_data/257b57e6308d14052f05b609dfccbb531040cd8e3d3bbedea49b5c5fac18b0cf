originate in a bug in the vk_mem crate's `Default` implementation for `AllocatorCreateInfo` [here](https://github.com/sebbbi/rust_test/blob/main/src/vulkan_base.rs#L354). Calling `AllocatorCreateInfo::Default()` initializes the `ash::Device` struct with `mem::zeroed()` as seen [here](https://docs.rs/vk-mem/0.2.2/src/vk_mem/lib.rs.html#271), which according to the runtime panic message is invalid (although I'm not familiar with the specific Rust rules which prevent this.)\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid this bug in the vk_mem crate, the `Default::default()` call needs to be avoided here and the default values need to be initialized manually, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet allocator_create_info = vk_mem::AllocatorCreateInfo {\r\n    physical_device: pdevice,\r\n    device: device.clone(),\r\n    instance: instance.clone(),\r\n    flags: vk_mem::AllocatorCreateFlags::NONE,\r\n    preferred_large_heap_block_size: 0,\r\n    frame_in_use_count: 0,\r\n    heap_size_limits: None,\r\n};\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/784","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rustc-perf","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/784/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/784/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/784/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/784","id":718613986,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MTg2MTM5ODY=","number":784,"title":"Static files on the site does not have a Content-Type response header","user":{"login":"Rob--W","id":1365071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjUwNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1365071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rob--W","html_url":"https://github.com/Rob--W","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rob--W/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rob--W/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rob--W/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rob--W/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rob--W/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rob--W/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rob--W/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rob--W/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rob--W/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-10-10T12:51:48Z","updated_at":"2020-10-15T13:00:42Z","closed_at":"2020-10-15T13:00:42Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"The perf.rust-lang.org site does not set the Content-Type response header.
