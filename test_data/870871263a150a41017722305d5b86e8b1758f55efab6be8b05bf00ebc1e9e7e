created an N2o protocol that routes messages over different family of application, (before that I used a cowboy websocket handler to do this job)\r\n\r\nSo for example I have this code in my protocol to send a message to a registered process\r\n\r\n```\r\ninfo({text,<<\"REG:\",Msg/binary>> }, Req, State) ->\r\n\t {[{_,Family}]}=jiffy:decode(Msg),\r\n\tTest = gproc:reg({p, l, Family}, 1), \r\n\t{reply, <<\"process registered successfully\">>, Req, State};\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ninfo({text,<<\"TRANSMIT:\",Msg/binary>> }=M, Req, State) ->\r\n

successfully\">>, Req, State};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my HTML client , firstly I register under the protocol with\r\n\r\n```\r\n var msg = {family: \"JS\"};\r\n    websocket.send(\"REG:\"+JSON.stringify(msg) );\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I verified that my html process was well registered\r\n\r\nThen , From My same HTML client, I called the transmit protocol method like:\r\n\r\n ```\r\nvar msg = {Type: \"TRANSMIT:\", Action: \"Chat\", From: \"JS\", To: \"JS\", Message: \"Hello I am Js\"}; \r\nwebsocket.send(\"TRANSMIT: \"+JSON.stringify(msg) );\r\n\r\n```\r\nBasically in this stage I should receive a message contain \"Hello I am Js\" in my HTML client, but Always I received an empty data string like:\r\n\r\n`MessageEvent {isTrusted: true, data: \"\", origin: \"ws://192.168.1.20:8000\", lastEventId: \"\", source: null…}\r\n`\r\nINFO: \r\n\r\nI well received the reply message as follows:\r\n\r\nwhen registering process: `MessageEvent {isTrusted: true, data: \"process registered successfully\", origin: \"ws://192.168.1.20:8000\", lastEventId: \"\", source: null…}`\r\n\r\nwhen submitting message:   `MessageEvent {isTrusted: true, data: \"message transmitted successfully\", origin: \"ws://192.168.1.20:8000\", lastEventId: \"\", source: null…}\r\n`\r\n\r\nAlso When I used my cowboy ws handler I didn't experience such
