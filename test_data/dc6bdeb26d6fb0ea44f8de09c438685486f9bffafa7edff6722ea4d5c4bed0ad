found a few other issues that look like they are related to this problem, but they are all closed and I'm not sure what the status of this bug is, so I'm making a new issue here...\r\n\r\nAs an example I've defined two routes, one to get a user by their ID, and another to get a user by their email:\r\n```\r\n\tapiRoutes := r.Engine.Group(\"/api\")\r\n\tapiRoutes.GET(\"/users/:id\", GetUser)\r\n\tapiRoutes.GET(\"/users/email/:email\", GetUser)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try and build, I get this error:\r\n```\r\npanic: path segment 'email/:email' conflicts with existing wildcard ':id' in path '/api/users/email/:email'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that these routes are NOT ambiguous and shouldn't conflict.  I'm using Gin in several APIs and run into this problem in all of them in various ways.  The above code is just a simplified demonstration of the bug.\r\n\r\nBased on the closed issues I've found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/205\r\nhttps://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/388\r\n\r\nThat last issue referenced this open issue in httprouter:\r\nhttps://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter/issues/73\r\n\r\n...but that issue hasn't been updated since 2015...\r\n\r\nSo it seems the Gin team is aware of this bug, but it isn't clear whether or not it's going to be fixed.
