I'm at the point now where I've (unfortunately) coupled the router and it's grouping mechanisms tightly to my app, so migrating to a new router will be a tedious process.\r\n\r\nI really like the way gin with it's versioning and middleware and so on; it is perfect for my use cases. It just has one problem which is the lack of ability to use standard REST endpoints. Having to do really ugly things with query params to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, I sometimes need endpoints like `/items/username/:username`, `/items/:id/foo`, `/items/:slug/bar` and so on all at the same time, but this router does not allow mixing those endpoints together because of the ambiguity. It can't differentiate the three obviously different paths.\r\n\r\nHow could I swap out the `authorized.GET` with a mux `router.Get`?
