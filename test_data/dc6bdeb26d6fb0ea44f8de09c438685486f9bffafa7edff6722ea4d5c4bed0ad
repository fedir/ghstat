v9](gopkg.in/go-playground/validator.v9) from v8.\r\n\r\nMoreover it prevents anyone from changing the the [binding.Validator](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/blob/master/binding/binding.go#L45) to use any other validation library besides `go-playground/validator.v8`, although I love that gin has adopted my library as their default, there are others and why the [binding.StructValidator](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/blob/master/binding/binding.go#L31) interface exists in the first place.\r\n\r\nLastly the addition was unnecessary, even if it made it more convenient, anyone could have just created a new instance of validator registered what they wanted and created a struct comply with [binding.StructValidator](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/blob/master/binding/binding.go#L31), much like in my instructions on [updating to use v9 of validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/tree/v9/_examples/gin-upgrading-overriding); which is also broken due to this change.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, I believe that an example of how to override the default validator would be more beneficial and could easily be copy-paste.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope this can be corrected, although I am not a member of the gin team, I feel very close
