am working with this tool and would like to put the entire thing behind an SSO solution. This means that I do not want anyone to even view a page unless they have authenticated through our SSO provider. I have been able to lock the whole thing down using SSL and SSO, and I have SSO user's coming into the system with 'guest' permissions. \r\n\r\nNow that I can get users to load into the application after signing in, I want them to be viewing the pages WITHOUT seeing the Apos UI...this lead me to the following file:\r\n\r\n**lib/modules/apostrophe-templates/views/outerLayoutBase.html**\r\n\r\n```   \r\n{% block apostropheMenu %}\r\n  {{ apos.adminBar.output() }}\r\n{% endblock %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file clearly places the admin UI into a block, which makes it very easy for me to override and hide the admin bar using the following permission check:\r\n\r\n**lib/modules/apostrophe-templates/views/outerLayout.html**\r\n```\r\n{% extends \"outerLayoutBase.html\" %}\r\n{% block apostropheMenu %}\r\n  {% if data.user._permission.edit %}\r\n    {{ apos.adminBar.output() }}\r\n  {% endif %}\r\n{% endblock %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the user 'Page Menu' is still visible to the guest user, which is not desirable. My proposal here is this:\r\n\r\nDo you think we could get the Apos UI placed into a block that can be overridden like the Apos Admin UI?\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething like this perhaps:\r\n\r\n**lib/modules/apostrophe-templates/views/outerLayoutBase.html**\r\n``` \r\n{% block apostrophePageMenu %}\r\n      {% if data.user %}\r\n        <div class=\"apos-ui\">\r\n          <div class=\"apos-context-menu-container\">\r\n            {{ apos.pages.publishMenu({ publishMenu: data.publishMenu, page: data.page, piece: data.piece, bottom: true }) }}\r\n            {{ apos.pages.menu({ contextMenu: data.contextMenu, page: data.page, bottom: true })}}\r\n            {{ apos.pages.afterContextMenu() }}\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      {% endif %}\r\n{% endblock %}\r\n```\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues/1356","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apostrophecms/apostrophe","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues/1356/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues/1356/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues/1356/events","html_url":"https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues/1356","id":320920488,"number":1356,"title":"Should be possible to create a group with the CLI and skip hardcoded groups in app.js","user":{"login":"boutell","id":32125,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell","html_url":"https://github.com/boutell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"boutell","id":32125,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell","html_url":"https://github.com/boutell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"boutell","id":32125,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell","html_url":"https://github.com/boutell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boutell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-05-07T19:10:10Z","updated_at":"2018-05-07T19:58:33Z","closed_at":"2018-05-07T19:58:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Right now you must have hardcoded groups in app.js when you first create a site.

The change of the URL in Apostrophe is *permanent*. This is also recommended by Google, see https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93633?hl=en\r\n\r\n> If you need to change the URL of a page as it is shown in search engine results, we recommend that you use a server-side 301 redirect. This is the best way to ensure that users and search engines are directed to the correct page. The 301 status code means that a page has permanently moved to a new location.\r\n\r\nThe redirect is happening here: https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/blob/master/lib/modules/apostrophe-soft-redirects/index.js#L45\r\n\r\nI'll provide a PR.
