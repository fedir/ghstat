Current easy-to-use variant, `CB` + `nginx` as proxy, crashes on chunked encoding and other `HTTP/1.1` features. This is because nginx does not support `HTTP/1.1`.\n\nBy now, other possible crunches are:\n- `CB` + `apache` + `mod_proxy` + `mod_ssl` - it works! But have much more complexity (compared with `nginx`).\n- Run two instances of `CB` in cluster: disadvantages are overhead of session replication, double RAM consumption and overall system design looks ugly.\n\nAlso, a patch was proposed some time ago.\nHope, this will be implemented in future.\n\n[Original message from google-groups](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/chicagoboss/ap5YSCEbySE/discussion).\nSome related patches was in pull-request #44 \"Multiple listeners\".\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ulfa/speiseplan/issues/8","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ulfa/speiseplan","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ulfa/speiseplan/issues/8/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ulfa/speiseplan/issues/8/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ulfa/speiseplan/issues/8/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ulfa/speiseplan/issues/8","id":38703419,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODcwMzQxOQ==","number":8,"title":"Umlaute in Mail","user":{"login":"ulfa","id":407175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzE3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/407175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfa","html_url":"https://github.com/ulfa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-07-25T07:21:57Z","updated_at":"2015-03-15T17:54:53Z","closed_at":"2014-08-31T16:26:28Z","author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss/issues/522","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss/issues/522/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss/issues/522/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss/issues/522/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ChicagoBoss/ChicagoBoss/issues/522","id":48523317,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0ODUyMzMxNw==","number":522,"title":"Aleppo compile failed","user":{"login":"pixelfields","id":2110218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTAyMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2110218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixelfields","html_url":"https://github.com/pixelfields","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixelfields/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixelfields/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixelfields/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixelfields/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixelfields/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixelfields/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixelfields/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixelfields/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixelfields/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2014-11-12T15:33:08Z","updated_at":"2015-03-23T03:34:49Z","closed_at":"2015-01-18T15:26:05Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hi all, \nI try to compile CB, but it's failed on aleppo.
