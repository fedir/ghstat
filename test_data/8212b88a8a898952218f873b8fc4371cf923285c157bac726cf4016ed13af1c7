They have a problem with requests that \"hang\" for a very long time before they are completed with empty responses.\r\n\r\nI think this could be due to a race-condition in the method handleGenericContinuation of the class LiftServlet. This method (directly and indirectly) calls the suspend and resume methods of the ServletAsyncProvider interface but does not guarantee that suspend is called before resume. As far as I can see, the order of the calls can depend on the scheduling of threads. And indeed, after having inserted debug traces and attaching a debugger to the server I have the impression that the resume method is sometimes called before the suspend method, leading to the hanging requests we're seeing. Please see mailing list thread for more information.\r\n\r\nMinor correction to what I wrote in the mailing list thread: I claimed that the NullPointerExceptions we are seeing are thrown from the complete method of the underlying Servlet 3.0 API.

javax.servlet.UnavailableException, which it should not because the exception is here to tell the application server that the servlet failed to boot.\r\n\r\nIn Lift 2.6.x, it was even worse because the method was catching ALL exceptions, even Errors. \r\n\r\n*How to reproduce*\r\nThrows a javax.servlet.UnavailableException in Lift boot() method.

The UnavailableException was a conventionnal way to tell the web-app server that something went horribly wrong during init and the servlet is  unavailable.

I think my time as well as others is valuable, so why go through 50 channels to discuss the same issue, this is insane.\r\n\r\nEver since 3.0, Lift has become extremely unstable to handle, and randomly breaks because CSP doesn't evaluate properly. Setup is also arbitrarily ignored, even if production settings are forced in dev mode for validation, there are things in Lift that probably silently fail or at the very least bubble up as a failure to parse the CSP report, it's an extremely flaky feature for whatever reason, meaning sometimes everything starts up normally, sometimes it blows up with a CSP report exception, even though nothing changes?\r\n\r\nI can only assume it's a variant of the same problem outlined below, which is that there's an error so early in the init pipeline the endpoint that should return the CSP doesn't come back with anything and therefore none of the content sources on a page are valid.\r\n\r\nReplicating:\r\n\r\n- Elastic Beanstalk\r\n- 64bit Amazon Linux 2016.09 v2.5.3\r\n- Running Tomcat 8 Java 8\r\n\r\nThe first welcoming error:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\norg.apache.catalina.LifecycleException: An invalid Lifecycle transition was attempted ([before_init]) for component [Connector[HTTP/1.1-8080]] in state [INITIALIZED]\r\n\tat org.apache.catalina.util.LifecycleBase.invalidTransition(LifecycleBase.java:402)\r\n\tat org.apache.catalina.util.LifecycleBase.init(LifecycleBase.java:102)\r\n\tat org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService.initInternal(StandardService.java:549)\r\n\tat org.apache.catalina.util.LifecycleBase.init(LifecycleBase.java:107)\r\n\tat org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer.initInternal(StandardServer.java:875)\r\n\tat org.apache.catalina.util.LifecycleBase.init(LifecycleBase.java:107)\r\n\tat org.apache.catalina.util.LifecycleBase.start(LifecycleBase.java:140)\r\n\tat org.apache.catalina.startup.Tomcat.start(Tomcat.java:343)\r\n\tat webapp.runner.launch.Main.main(Main.java:275)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBehaviour:\r\n\r\n- Lift inconsistently works or fails depending on weather conditions\r\n- Updating or re-deploying Lift seems to trigger some extremely vulnerable CSP related internals that just blow up when the world is dearest.\r\n- This has been happening for quite a while, across many Lift framework versions.\r\n\r\nI think there should be some kind of strong compatibility notice with Lift, explicitly saying the fra

There are daemons and dragons in Lift that currently make it impossible to work with on AWS/Tomcat and since there's no servlet-less flavour, every increment of new releases has made our lives ever more painful.\r\n\r\nIt's along this part of the log everything consistently goes south, through very unpredictably.

`HTTPRequest` inside. Ergo, when we call `HttpRequest.snapshot` in `Req.snapshot`, we get a NPE. The basic question is what to do with `Req` when you're in a comet context.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we modified `currentReq` in both definitions of `buildDeferredFunction` so that they filter out null requests:\r\n\r\n`val currentReq = S.request.filter(_.request != null).map(_.snapshot)`\r\n\r\nThe situation is basically:\r\n\r\n - Someone sends a message to a comet.\r\n - We try to create a deferred function (in this case, it's for the future-with-session\r\n   helpers that Piotr created) for lazy-loading.\r\n - The deferred function builder tries to snapshot the current HTTPRequest.\r\n - That object is null (due to being in a comet context), and things go boom.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lift/framework/issues/1828","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lift/framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lift/framework/issues/1828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lift/framework/issues/1828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lift/framework/issues/1828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/lift/framework/issues/1828","id":209343513,"number":1828,"title":"Investigate SameSite Cookie Support","user":{"login":"farmdawgnation","id":620189,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/620189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation","html_url":"https://github.com/farmdawgnation","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"farmdawgnation","id":620189,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/620189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation","html_url":"https://github.com/farmdawgnation","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"farmdawgnation","id":620189,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/620189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation","html_url":"https://github.com/farmdawgnation","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farmdawgnation/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-22T03:39:43Z","updated_at":"2017-08-12T16:35:38Z","closed_at":"2017-08-12T16:35:37Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"SameSite Cookies are gaining some traction recently, now having support in Chrome and Opera.
