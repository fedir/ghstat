a user I want to be able to edit the layout of a page and see the changes in the content right away.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nWhen user edit the layout of a page and then click \"Content\" it should the changes reflected in the page.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nWhen user edit a layout of a page and click in \"Content\" the recent changes in the layout are not reflected in the content of the page.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nThe problem is [here](https://github.com/dotCMS/core-web/blob/master/src/app/portlets/dot-edit-page/dot-edit-page-routing.module.ts#L10:L38), we only load the content on the page once in the resolver, we might have 2 options:\r\n1. Add the resolver in every child route\r\n2. Update the page state after any save <-- I think this could be better, we might have to tests.\r\n\r\n## Known Workarounds\r\nRefresh the page to see the changes.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->\r\n<!--- reproduce this bug.

Even if the push from the workflow fails for some reason, it should **NOT** un-index the content when it fails.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nTaking any workflow action which includes the \"Push Publish\" or \"Push Now\" sub-actions both:\r\n\r\n* Fails to successfully push the item.\r\n* Causes the content item to be un-indexed.\r\n\r\n## Known Workarounds\r\n\r\nPush content using the default action (e.g. right-click on the content item in the Content Search screen and select \"Push Publish\").\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\n\r\n1. Log on to the dotCMS authoring server.\r\n2. Go to the Content Search screen.\r\n3. Create a new content item of the Documentation content type.\r\n    * Enter value for all required fields, and copy the \"URL Title\" value to the \"Wiki Title\" field.\r\n    * Select \"Save Draft\" to save the content.\r\n4. From the Content Search screen, click the new content item to re-open it in the content editing screen.\r\n5. Select the \"Publish & Push\" action.\r\n    * Leave all fields in the push publish popup at the default - just add the \"dotcms.com\" push environment and press the \"Push\" button.\r\n\r\n**Result:** The new content item disappears from the Content Search screen.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nCurrently the only way we can successfully push documentation content from auth to prod is by using the default \"Push Publish\" action (e.g. right-click on the item in the Content Search screen).  So our workflow is broken.\r\n\r\nWill believes this may be a bug in the API, which means it's potentially urgent.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* Workflow sub-actions which come *before* the push sub-action work correctly.\r\n    * I don't know if any workflow sub-actions which come *after* the push action work or not - I haven't tried adding any after the push sub-action yet.\r\n* I haven't yet tried to recreate this on a server other than our authoring server.\r\n* This doesn't appear to be a problem with a corrupted workflow.\r\n    * I re-created the workflow from scratch, but the problem still happens.\r\n* This might potentially be an issue with a corrupted push env (I didn't try recreating the push env yet).\r\n    * But the push env works fine with a default action push (right-click \"Push Publish\").\r\n    * And the push env worked fine before the 4.3.x release.\r\n    * And finally even if the push env got corrupted somehow, it still obviously shouldn't cause the content to be un-indexed.\r\n* This is a new problem.\r\n    * I believe it just started happening with the 4.3.x upgrade, but can't be 100% sure of the timing.\r\n* There is a potentially related issue that, after a content item is un-indexed, it takes **at least** two re-indexes to get the item to show up again in the back-end.\r\n    * Most of the time a full re-index followed by a re-index of only the Documentation content type makes the content come back.\r\n    * However at least once it has required a full re-index, followed by a re-index of the content type, followed by another full re-index before the content appeared in the Content Search screen again.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n* dotCMS version used: 4.3.2\r\n* Operating System and version: AWS Linux (auth)\r\n* Application Server and version: Tomcat 1.8 (distro)\r\n* Java Brand and version: 1.8 (auth)\r\n* Database and version: Postgres

some content has a tag that eventually is deleted from Tags portlet, this deleted tag keeps showing in the search results when you run an ES query.\r\nIn addition, when you go to Edit the same content that had the tag, you can see the tag is still showing unless you flush all caches from Maintenance portlet.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nOnce the tag is delete, ES should not display the tag in the search results.\r\nIn addition, that deleted tag should not show up when you go to the Edit the content that had the tag previously.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n After the tag is deleted rom Tags portlet, this deleted tag keeps showing in the search results when you run an ES query.\r\nIn addition, when you go to Edit the same content that had the tag, you can see the tag is still showing unless you flush all caches from Maintenance portlet.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\n1. Login to dotcms \r\n2. Navigate to Dev Tools> ES Search\r\n3. Run the following query\r\n```\r\n{\r\n       \"query\": {\r\n          \"query_string\": {\r\n             \"query\": \"+contenttype:news\"\r\n          }\r\n       },\r\n       \"aggs\" : {\r\n          \"tag\" : {\r\n             \"terms\" : {\r\n                \"field\": \"tags\",\r\n                \"size\" : 20\r\n             }\r\n          }\r\n       },\r\n       \"size\":0    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. You may see something like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8741846/37046252-7e94e434-212d-11e8-8bfa-ec0c891d94ea.png)\r\n\r\n5. Choose one of the tags displayed in the list (i.e.\"**debt**\") and delete it directly by going to Types & Tags> Tags portlet\r\n6. Run again the same ES query on step 3. You will see the tag is still showing in the list.\r\n7. In addition, if you look for those contents that had the tag before it was deleted, you can see that those contents still show the tag even when now it's been deleted, for example:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"bool\": {\r\n      \"must\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"term\": {\r\n            \"news.tags\": \"debt\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Search results:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8741846/37046319-b1946e4a-212d-11e8-9814-7e63eb6fbfda.png)\r\n\r\n- Content still shows deleted
