Login to dotcms \r\n2. Navigate to Dev Tools> ES Search\r\n3. Run the following query\r\n```\r\n{\r\n       \"query\": {\r\n          \"query_string\": {\r\n             \"query\": \"+contenttype:news\"\r\n          }\r\n       },\r\n       \"aggs\" : {\r\n          \"tag\" : {\r\n             \"terms\" : {\r\n                \"field\": \"tags\",\r\n                \"size\" : 20\r\n             }\r\n          }\r\n       },\r\n       \"size\":0    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n4.

Choose one of the tags displayed in the list (i.e.\"**debt**\") and delete it directly by going to Types & Tags> Tags portlet\r\n6. Run again the same ES query on step 3. You will see the tag is still showing in the list.\r\n7.
