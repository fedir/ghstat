That seemed reasonable, but I've always wondered if the `#js` requirement was worth the benefit of the optimization, so I decided to try to quantify it.\r\n\r\nI did the following experiment:\r\n\r\nRender 10 divs containing 90 spans at 60fps, while measuring the time to render.\r\n\r\nBEFORE code changes:\r\nnil props: Early iterations at about 1.95ms/frame, converging towards 0.67ms/frame\r\n3k/v  pairs in `#js` obj as props: Early iterations 2.5ms/frame, converging to 1ms/frame\r\n\r\nAFTER code changes:\r\nnil props: no measurable effect\r\nJS obj 3k/v pairs: no measurable difference\r\nCLJ obj 3k/v pairs: Early iterations 6-7ms/frame, converging to 2.07ms/frame\r\n\r\nTo ground-truth this I ran a few simple timings on map conversions, and a single k/v map seems to take about 3-4 microseconds to convert. A map with 3 entries takes about 10 microseconds (when done in units of 100 iterations). Thus, I would expect the overhead for `clj->js` in this benchmark to consume about 1ms/frame, which is exactly what I did measure.\r\n\r\nI then measured the overall browser performance flame chart to get an idea of how long the frame was actually taking from the complete React standpoint (all DOM was needing a refresh because I was changing content).\r\n\r\nNO (nil) props:\r\nUser code execution: 2.1ms\r\nOverall time including browser paint: 3.5ms\r\n\r\nCLJ props:\r\nUser code: 4.3ms\r\nOverall time including browser paint: 6ms\r\n\r\nSo, now we can gain some perspective if we relate this to a target frame time max of 16ms as the target number to maintain full 60fps animation rates. \r\n\r\nFulcro, of course, has overhead of the query engine. That is a relatively heavy task, so let's say we allocate half of this time to query engine concerns. This leaves our rendering task 8ms. \r\n\r\nIf we assume an average update on the order of 100 DOM elements (which is generous considering shouldComponentUpdate should prevent non-essential changes), then using clj maps for properties should represent no more than about 1/8th of our usable time (assuming all nodes needed props, which again is quite generous).\r\n\r\nUser code execution in the flame graph indicates that React consumes about 1.3 to 2ms/frame for this task. \r\n\r\nOne can conclude that most common web applications will not see a significant performance impact from using clj maps; however, if they do these measurements also show that the inclusion of the suggested `cond` in the DOM generation functions has such a small effect as to be immeasurable in the face of performance deviations.\r\n\r\nThus, I'm proposing we add support for all DOM tag functions to support auto-conversion of clj maps. The cond I'm suggesting check the cheapest conditions first: nil and `object?`, followed by `map?`. If neither is found we can either return what we were passed or throw an exception. Not sure which is best yet, as I'm worried there may be a way to pass props that would not be detected as `object?` but would be acceptable to react.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/144","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/144/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/144/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/144/events","html_url":"https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/144","id":296835966,"number":144,"title":"Pristine

Users should be able to cancel previously scheduled loads from the queue, and also once in flight.\r\n\r\nProbable implementation: Assign a load a UUID, and return it from the call to load to load-action. Calling cancel-load on that UUID will remove it from the queue or cancel it if in flight. It will be a no-op if it isn't found.\r\n\r\nIt might be easier to use the new load markers as the join point.  That makes it more abstract, but it does make the \"uniqueness\" guarantee harder. Perhaps a combo? Allow a UUID, but also allow just a marker name.\r\n\r\nCommon use-cases:\r\n- Ask for a report/resource that takes a while, and then decide to navigate elsewhere. \r\n- Navigate to a page that needs resources, then navigate away before it finishes loading\r\n\r\nIt is possible that a navigation operation could just be loading an alternative, and that cancelling would be targeting the same marker as the load...but in that case order of operations can help (you code the cancel first). \r\n\r\nThis runs into problems where you try to hook cancel into lifecycle...e.g. component unmount cancelling a marker that some other component mount uses to load. The easy workaround, though, is just to ensure you use unique load marker names for distinct components.\r\n\r\n- [x] Allow loads to specify an abort ID.\r\n- [x] Allow mutations to specify an abort ID.\r\n- [x] Allow cancelling requests in queue.\r\n- [x] Allow cancelling requests in flight.\r\n- [x] Support for middleware the can rewrite requests.\r\n- [x] Support for middleware that can rewrite responses.\r\n- [x] Split mutation transactions on abort ID (mutations mixed with an abort should not be affected).\r\n- [x] Split loads based on abort ID (so other loads are not aborted with it).\r\n- [x] Use the transaction and body from *modified* middleware response for merge.\r\n- [x] Finish documentation\r\n- [x] Allow response middleware to convert errors to ok\r\n- [ ] Implement `:serial? false`\r\n- [x] Patch Fulcro Inspect\r\n- [x] Consider if the request middlewares real body should be available on response middleware.

Currently locale and translations are shared by all apps on the screen\r\n\r\nThe new design does the following, which is still under review and may change:\r\n\r\n- Place translation data at a top-level namespaced key in app state. Possibly store the translations in metadata so it doesn't \"pollute\" the debuggability of looking at the database? \r\n- Use `shared-fn` to make translations available in components\r\n- Change tr to require `this` (a component) so it can get xlations from shared props\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Able to easily load translations from the server the same way we load everything else, directly from PO files\r\n- Can write a full-stack devtool to let translators do translation in-place in the app's UI, and save the results to the server (i.e. directly to the PO files). No sending out files!\r\n- Localization becomes completely app-specific\r\n- There is no code generation, modules, or other complicated build process\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Translations only work in Fulcro components. A \"global\" function to use inside of non-fulcro code would need a way to get to a component or the reconciler.\r\n- Added parameter to the translation wrapper (this)\r\n- Not backward compatible with existing support\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/140","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/140/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/140/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/140/events","html_url":"https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/140","id":296029545,"number":140,"tit
