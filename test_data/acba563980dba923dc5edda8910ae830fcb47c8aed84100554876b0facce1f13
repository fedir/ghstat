Let's say you created a new entity on your local database and then send a remote mutation, your DB before the remote will be like this:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n{:entity/by-id {TEMP_ID {:entity/id           TEMP_ID\r\n                         :entity/initial-data \"bla\"}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, let's say you asked for the `[:entity/id :entity/created-at]` from your mutation join. After the mutation join get merged, the local DB will be like this:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n{:entity/by-id {TEMP_ID {:entity/id           TEMP_ID\r\n                         :entity/initial-data \"bla\"}\r\n                123     {:entity/id         123\r\n                         :entity/created-at \"DATE\"}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when the tempid transform kicks in, it just replaces every occurence of TEMP_ID with the new ID, in thie case ther eis a TEMP_ID on a map key, which will make the previous data to be overriden instead of merged, ending up with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{:entity/by-id {123 {:entity/id           123\r\n                     :entity/initial-data \"bla\"}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of the expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{:entity/by-id {123 {:entity/id           123\r\n                     :entity/created-at   \"DATE\"\r\n                     :entity/initial-data \"bla\"}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this can be fixed by changing the order of things, and converting tempids before doing the mutation join merge.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/187","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/187/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/187/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/187/events","html_url":"https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/187","id":321523221,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjE1MjMyMjE=","number":187,"title":"Provide ebook","user":{"login":"NightMachinary","id":36224762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjI0NzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/36224762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightMachinary","html_url":"https://github.com/NightMachinary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightMachinary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightMachinary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightMachinary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightMachinary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightMachinary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightMachinary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightMachinary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightMachinary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightMachinary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-05-09T10:53:26Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T15:00:29Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T15:00:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can you provide [book.fulcrologic.com](book.fulcrologic.com) as ebook?

You may have other ideas. Hot code reload should not be an issue because that ns should not change. (We could also add code to `t` itself to check for a hook, but since that is called a lot in a UI I prefer to keep it as light as possible. If anything I think it deserves as much optimization as possible.)\r\n\r\nThe instrumented `t` can collect strings, and emit extra DOM. Forcing a root render makes it easy to gather everything on-screen on demand.\r\n\r\nEditing them sends a mutation to the server and updates the locale in app state, and forces a root render again.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if a locale is loaded you can look for strings that have keys but no translation (as a tab of \"missing translation\").\r\n\r\nI guess we need functionality to update PO files on disk. Technically on server-side there isn't really a requirement to use PO files at all, but since other tools work well with them it should be there. The new support makes it pretty easy to move i18n strings into a real database on the server.\r\n\r\nThe new i18n already supports putting the po files on disk (instead of in the uberjar), so that would make running this on a staging server for translators to use easy..not going to be able to write to a PO file in a resource path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/156","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/156/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/156/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/156/events","html_url":"https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/156","id":300778284,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMDA3NzgyODQ=","number":156,"title":"Update TODO MVC and Template with new i18n support","user":{"login":"awkay","id":1177083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1177083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay","html_url":"https://github.com/awkay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"awkay","id":1177083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1177083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay","html_url":"https://github.com/awkay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"awkay","id":1177083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1177083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay","html_url":"https://github.com/awkay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awkay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-02-27T20:19:26Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T01:24:21Z","closed_at":"2018-03-06T01:24:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- [x] Move po files into a resource path\r\n- [x] Update string extraction helpers (e.g. Makefile) to output to the po dir\r\n- [x] Update server to serve the PO files from the proper query\r\n- [x] Fix the client to use new support, with Yahoo and IBM ICU\r\n- [ ] Possibly use Google Closure's i18n formatting for todo mvc, since it does no SSR...would show alt plugin.\r\n","score":1.0}]}
