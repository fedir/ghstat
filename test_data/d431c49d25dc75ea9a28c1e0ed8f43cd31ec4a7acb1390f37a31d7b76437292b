(#7984)\n\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nJava11 disallow draining any remaining bytes from the socket if a write causes a connection reset. This should be completely safe to do. At the moment if a write is causing a connection-reset you basically loose all the pending bytes that are sitting on the socket and are waiting to be read.\r\n\r\nThis happens because SocketOutputStream.write(…) may call AbstractPlainSocketImpl.setConnectionReset(…). Once this method is called any read(…) call will just throw a SocketException without even attempt to read any remaining data.\r\n\r\nThis is related:\r\n - https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8199329\r\n - http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk/rev/92cca24c8807\r\n - http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/net-dev/2018-May/011511.html\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nTolarate if remaining bytes could not be read when using OIO.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nBe able to build Netty and run testsuite while using Java11"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/4b728cd5bc53195bced516f33a1ea0a0def5604e","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/4b728cd5bc53195bced516f33a1ea0a0def5604e","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/4b728cd5bc53195bced516f33a1ea0a0def5604e/comments","author":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"0c6f077c18d2a721b94a4fe89bc44157cb1b6a66","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/0c6f077c18d2a721b94a4fe89bc44157cb1b6a66","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/0c6f077c18d2a721b94a4fe89bc44157cb1b6a66"}]},{"sha":"0c6f077c18d2a721b94a4fe89bc44157cb1b6a66","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTA2NDU2MzowYzZmMDc3YzE4ZDJhNzIxYjk0YTRmZTg5YmM0NDE1N2NiMWI2YTY2","commit":{"author":{"name":"Norman Maurer","email":"norman_maurer@apple.com","date":"2018-05-29T09:09:22Z"},"committer":{"name":"GitHub","email":"noreply@github.com","date":"2018-05-29T09:09:22Z"},"message":"Allow to test with boringssl-static and drop into shell (#7980)\n\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nWe also need to run our tests while using boringssl-static to ensure everything works when using it.

(#7948)\n\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nWe did not guard against the case of calling malloc(0) when creating a ByteBuffer without a Cleaner. The problem is that malloc(0) can have different behaviour, it either return a null-pointer or a valid pointer that you can pass to free.\r\n\r\nThe real problem arise if Unsafe.allocateMemory(0) returns 0 and we use it as the memoryAddress of the ByteBuffer. The problem here is that native libraries test for 0 and handle it as a null-ptr.

(#7948)\n\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nWe did not guard against the case of calling malloc(0) when creating a ByteBuffer without a Cleaner. The problem is that malloc(0) can have different behaviour, it either return a null-pointer or a valid pointer that you can pass to free.\r\n\r\nThe real problem arise if Unsafe.allocateMemory(0) returns 0 and we use it as the memoryAddress of the ByteBuffer. The problem here is that native libraries test for 0 and handle it as a null-ptr. This is for example true in SSL.bioSetByteBuffer(...) which would throw a NPE when 0 is used as memoryAddress and so produced errors during SSL usage.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\n- Always allocate 1 byte as minimum (even if we ask for an empty buffer).\r\n- Add unit test.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nNo more errors possible because of malloc(0)."}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/c3d29f7b9ef138aecaff8b1c6cd631d742d6b22a","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/c3d29f7b9ef138aecaff8b1c6cd631d742d6b22a","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/c3d29f7b9ef138aecaff8b1c6cd631d742d6b22a/comments","author":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"546ddd2c2899b8e410ddfac6b3987d4108b65c17","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/546ddd2c2899b8e410ddfac6b3987d4108b65c17","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/546ddd2c2899b8e410ddfac6b3987d4108b65c17"}]}]
