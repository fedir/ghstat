In all\r\nother implementations of `ByteBuf` the accessible is not checked by\r\n`capacity` method. We can assign an empty array to `array`\r\nin the `deallocate` and don't worry about NPE in the `#capacity`.\r\nThis will help reduce the number of repeated calls of the\r\n`#ensureAccessible` in many operations with `UnpooledHeapByteBuf`.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n1. Remove `#ensureAccessible` call from `UnpooledHeapByteBuf#capacity`.\r\nUse the `EmptyArrays#EMPTY_BYTES` instead of `null` in `#deallocate`.\r\n\r\n2. Fix access checks in `AbstractUnsafeSwappedByteBuf` and\r\n`AbstractByteBuf#slice` that relied on `#ensureAccessible`\r\nin `UnpooledHeapByteBuf#capacity`.

However if\r\nthe user has auto read on, or calls read again, we may propagate the\r\nsame user events again. If the underlying transport continuously\r\nnotifies us that there is read activity this will happen in a spin loop\r\nwhich consumes unnecessary CPU.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- AbstractNioByteChannel's unsafe read() should check if the input side\r\nof the socket has been shutdown before processing the event. This is\r\nconsistent with EPOLL and KQUEUE transports.\r\n- add unit test with @normanmaurer's help, and make transports consistent with respect to user events\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nNo more read spin loop in NIO when the channel is half closed.","tree":{"sha":"43c6345efcbf1f0aafda0ad4f97f63f3120dd393","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/git/trees/43c6345efcbf1f0aafda0ad4f97f63f3120dd393"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/git/commits/ed0668384b393c3502c2136e3cc412a5c8c9056e","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/ed0668384b393c3502c2136e3cc412a5c8c9056e","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/ed0668384b393c3502c2136e3cc412a5c8c9056e","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/ed0668384b393c3502c2136e3cc412a5c8c9056e/comments","author":{"login":"Scottmitch","id":7562868,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7562868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch","html_url":"https://github.com/Scottmitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"b309271e49cc596676c6002300cfc55f6d5a8cfd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/b309271e49cc596676c6002300cfc55f6d5a8cfd","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/b309271e49cc596676c6002300cfc55f6d5a8cfd"}]},{"sha":"b309271e49cc596676c6002300cfc55f6d5a8cfd","commit":{"author":{"name":"Bryce Anderson","email":"banderson@twitter.com","date":"2018-03-23T15:11:51Z"},"committer":{"name":"Norman Maurer","email":"norman.maurer@googlemail.com","date":"2018-03-28T17:54:30Z"},"message":"HttpServerUpgradeHandler shouldn't wait for flush to reshape pipeline\n\nMotivation:\n\nThere is a race between both flushing the upgrade response and receiving\nmore data before the flush ChannelPromise can fire and reshape the\npipeline.
