last-stream-id for HEADERS-triggered connection error (#10775)\n\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nWhen parsing HEADERS, connection errors can occur (e.g., too large of\r\nheaders, such that we don't want to HPACK decode them). These trigger a\r\nGOAWAY with a last-stream-id telling the client which streams haven't\r\nbeen processed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that last-stream-id didn't include the stream for the\r\nHEADERS that triggered the error. Since clients are free to silently\r\nretry streams not included in last-stream-id, the client is free to\r\nretransmit the request on a new connection, which will fail the\r\nconnection with the wrong last-stream-id, and the client is still free\r\nto retransmit the request.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nHave fatal connection errors (those that hard-cut the connection)\r\ninclude all streams in last-stream-id, which guarantees the HEADERS'\r\nstream is included and thus should not be silently retried by the HTTP/2\r\nclient.\r\n\r\nThis modification is heavy-handed, as it will cause racing streams to\r\nalso fail, but alternatives that provide precise last-stream-id tracking\r\nare much more invasive.

from an incoming\r\nrequest and uses them for building a response.\r\nAlthough the class does some validation while parsing the list,\r\nit then disables HTTP header validation when it builds a responst.\r\nThe disabled validation may potentially allow\r\nHTTP response splitting attacks.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\n- Enabled HTTP header validation in HttpServerUpgradeHandler\r\n  as a defense-in-depth measure to prevent possible\r\n  HTTP response splitting attacks.\r\n- Added a new constructor that allows disabling the validation.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nHttpServerUpgradeHandler validates incoming protocols\r\nbefore including them into a response.\r\nThat should prevent possible HTTP response splitting attacks."}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/26976310d26e11a850cf3cb0b9aa38287aefc1f8","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/26976310d26e11a850cf3cb0b9aa38287aefc1f8","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/26976310d26e11a850cf3cb0b9aa38287aefc1f8/comments","author":{"login":"artem-smotrakov","id":19523081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTIzMDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19523081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-smotrakov","html_url":"https://github.com/artem-smotrakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-smotrakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-smotrakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-smotrakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-smotrakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-smotrakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-smotrakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-smotrakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-smotrakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-smotrakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"7b736a3ae4efef8280aaf3b7165268ef5e1086b0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/7b736a3ae4efef8280aaf3b7165268ef5e1086b0","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/7b736a3ae4efef8280aaf3b7165268ef5e1086b0"}]}]
