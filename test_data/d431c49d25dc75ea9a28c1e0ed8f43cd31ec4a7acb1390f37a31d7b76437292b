check accessible in the #capacity method (#7830)\n\nMotivation:\r\nThe `#ensureAccessible` method in `UnpooledHeapByteBuf#capacity` used\r\nto prevent NPE if buffer is released and `array` is `null`. In all\r\nother implementations of `ByteBuf` the accessible is not checked by\r\n`capacity` method. We can assign an empty array to `array`\r\nin the `deallocate` and don't worry about NPE in the `#capacity`.\r\nThis will help reduce the number of repeated calls of the\r\n`#ensureAccessible` in many operations with `UnpooledHeapByteBuf`.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n1. Remove `#ensureAccessible` call from `UnpooledHeapByteBuf#capacity`.\r\nUse the `EmptyArrays#EMPTY_BYTES` instead of `null` in `#deallocate`.\r\n\r\n2. Fix access checks in `AbstractUnsafeSwappedByteBuf` and\r\n`AbstractByteBuf#slice` that relied on `#ensureAccessible`\r\nin `UnpooledHeapByteBuf#capacity`.

This is\r\nconsistent with EPOLL and KQUEUE transports.\r\n- add unit test with @normanmaurer's help, and make transports consistent with respect to user events\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nNo more read spin loop in NIO when the channel is half closed.","tree":{"sha":"43c6345efcbf1f0aafda0ad4f97f63f3120dd393","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/git/trees/43c6345efcbf1f0aafda0ad4f97f63f3120dd393"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/git/commits/ed0668384b393c3502c2136e3cc412a5c8c9056e","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/ed0668384b393c3502c2136e3cc412a5c8c9056e","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/ed0668384b393c3502c2136e3cc412a5c8c9056e","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/ed0668384b393c3502c2136e3cc412a5c8c9056e/comments","author":{"login":"Scottmitch","id":7562868,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7562868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch","html_url":"https://github.com/Scottmitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"b309271e49cc596676c6002300cfc55f6d5a8cfd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/b309271e49cc596676c6002300cfc55f6d5a8cfd","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/b309271e49cc596676c6002300cfc55f6d5a8cfd"}]},{"sha":"b309271e49cc596676c6002300cfc55f6d5a8cfd","commit":{"author":{"name":"Bryce Anderson","email":"banderson@twitter.com","date":"2018-03-23T15:11:51Z"},"committer":{"name":"Norman Maurer","email":"norman.maurer@googlemail.com","date":"2018-03-28T17:54:30Z"},"message":"HttpServerUpgradeHandler shouldn't wait for flush to reshape pipeline\n\nMotivation:\n\nThere is a race between both flushing the upgrade response and receiving\nmore data before the flush ChannelPromise can fire and reshape the\npipeline.
