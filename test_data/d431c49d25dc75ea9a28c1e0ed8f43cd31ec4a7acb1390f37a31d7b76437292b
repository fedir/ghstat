However, ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf does not override isWritable and ensureWritable, which can cause some handlers to mistakenly assume they can write to the ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf, resulting in ReadOnlyBufferException.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nAdded isWritable and ensureWritable method overrides on ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf to indicate that it is never writable. Added tests for these methods.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nCan successfully write ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf to a channel with an SslHandler (or any other handler which may attempt to write to the ByteBuf it receives).","tree":{"sha":"28056ea91984aa0912d3ebb8a92b7d746bc49617","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/git/trees/28056ea91984aa0912d3ebb8a92b7d746bc49617"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/git/commits/1b1f7677acec6a5ae06a552adc4c046b2ce2490d","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/1b1f7677acec6a5ae06a552adc4c046b2ce2490d","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/1b1f7677acec6a5ae06a552adc4c046b2ce2490d","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/1b1f7677acec6a5ae06a552adc4c046b2ce2490d/comments","author":{"login":"RikkiGibson","id":5833655,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5833655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikkiGibson","html_url":"https://github.com/RikkiGibson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikkiGibson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikkiGibson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikkiGibson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikkiGibson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikkiGibson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikkiGibson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikkiGibson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikkiGibson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikkiGibson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"48fe14402a98ed600fa14348984e688af725561c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/48fe14402a98ed600fa14348984e688af725561c","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/48fe14402a98ed600fa14348984e688af725561c"}]},{"sha":"48fe14402a98ed600fa14348984e688af725561c","commit":{"author":{"name":"Trustin
