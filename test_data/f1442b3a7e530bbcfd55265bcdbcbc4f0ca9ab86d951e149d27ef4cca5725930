We are trying update our gatsby packages so as to use some of the new features coming out. I've updated all my gatsby packages to their latest version except for `gatsby-source-apiserver`.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nI am seeing an error when running `gatsby build` during the **Building production Javascript and CSS bundles** step. After which the process completely freezes. There is no `Build Failed` message nor the does the terminal return to normal forcing me to ^C. Here's the error:\r\n```\r\n/home/propion/Projects/Bifrost/bifrost/frontend/node_modules/yoga-layout-prebuilt/yoga-layout/build/Release/nbind.js:53\r\n        throw ex;\r\n        ^\r\n\r\nError: Callback was already called.\r\n    at throwError (/home/propion/Projects/Bifrost/bifrost/frontend/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:16:11)\r\n    at /home/propion/Projects/Bifrost/bifrost/frontend/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2818:7\r\n    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:61:11)\r\n``` \r\nMy start command always runs `npx gatsby clean` first before running `npx gatsby build`. Building the development bundle works correctly with no errors. \r\n\r\nI've found similar issues but none of their solutions have worked\r\nhttps://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/25142\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/59575264/building-gatsby-site-on-netlify-err-callback-was-already-called\r\nhttps://community.netlify.com/t/first-time-trying-to-deploy-netlify-cms-gatsby-starter-template-fails/12977/8\r\n\r\nBased on the above I assume that it has something to do with `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms`\r\n\r\nI have tried:\r\n* Running on node 10, 12 and 14\r\n* Updating all relevant packages to their latest versions\r\n* Removing `package-lock.json` + `node_modules/` and running `npm install`\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I was unable to re-produce using a minimal build using the latest versions of `gatsby` and `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms` so I can only assume that it has something to do with the my environment that couldn't be replicated in the code-sandbox.\r\n\r\nMy `gatsby-config.js`, `gatsby-node.js` and `package.json` are massive so I will only be posting what I believe to the relevant sections. I would be happy to post more.\r\n\r\n**gatsby-config.js**\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    siteMetadata: {\r\n        siteUrl: \"https://www.singlestore.com\",\r\n    },\r\n    plugins: [\r\n

Description\r\n\r\nThe other day I was working on adding fonts and changing the favicon to a new image within my project (this touched the layout component and also I added the 'gatsby-plugin-manifest' plugin. Out of nowhere, the all.sass file is no longer being read appropriately. It's like my project thinks the sass file is a CSS file and it can't parse the sass file correctly. I've tried taking code from my main branch from a week ago and two weeks ago and I get the same exact compile issue even on these branches that were compiling just fine before two days ago. My netlify deploy was also still deploying correctly yesterday until I cleared the cache and now my netlify deploy is getting the same exact error that my local environment is experiencing.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. You should be able to pull the main branch and run npm install. REPO: https://github.com/andrewhosack/SeeYouTest\r\n\r\n2. At this point you can run npm start and you may experience some frontmatter errors but that is because there is some code missing in this repo (I've removed various files to not include in the test repo)\r\n\r\n3. If you wait for the build to continue you should get the following error: https://i.imgur.com/L1Irov7.png\r\n\r\n error  in ./src/components/all.sass\r\n⠀\r\nModule build failed (from ./node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js):\r\nModuleBuildError: Module build failed (from ./node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js):\r\n\r\n$kaldi-red: #D64000\r\n^\r\n      Media query expression must begin with '('\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected result\r\n\r\nBefore I started experiencing this error the code compiled just fine and the all.sass file was comiled as sass and the styles were applied to the website correctly. When I remove the sass components from this file and leave the proper CSS, the file is read just as a normal CSS file should be and the remaining styles are applied to the website correctly. The sass components are causing the compile to fail though.\r\n\r\n### Actual result\r\n\r\nSASS file is not compiling no matter what SASS plugins I try to install, no matter how many times i delete the package-lock.json and node modules folder and rerun npm install.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.18363\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @

Perhaps I'm doing something that is unintended for the deploy preview links feature. \r\n\r\nI'm using a combination of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and Netlify CMS to create a content management solution. I have a collection of content that allows for a [custom permalinks](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/permalinks/) page-by-page. This field is required, so it will always be filled out. \r\n\r\nHowever, I'm noticing that I cannot get [deploy preview links](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/deploy-preview-links/) to work nicely with this field. When I type a value into the permalinks field that contains a forward slash (`/`) indicating the insertion of a directory, the deploy preview link is not formatted correctly. \r\n\r\nHere is the configuration for this specific collection inside of `config.yml`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  ##\r\n  ## @collection: Landing pages\r\n  ## @description:\r\n  ##\r\n  - name: \"landing\"\r\n    label: \"Landing pages\"\r\n    label_singular: \"Landing page\"\r\n    folder: \"src/landings\"\r\n    create: true\r\n    extension: md\r\n    slug: \"{{slug}}\"\r\n    preview_path: \"{{permalink}}\" \r\n    fields:\r\n      - name: layout\r\n        widget: hidden\r\n        default: \"layouts/landing.html\"\r\n      - label: Title\r\n        name: title\r\n        widget: string\r\n        default: Hello World\r\n      - label: Permalink (e.g. \"my-landing/\" or \"landings/my-page/\", don't forget the trailing slash!)\r\n        name: permalink\r\n        widget: string\r\n        default: \"my-page/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** I have tried both `preview_path: \"{{permalink}}\"` and `preview_path: \"{{fields.permalink}}\"` and they have yielded the same result.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how I might use this permalink field inside of Netlify CMS: \r\n![Screen Shot 2020-10-02 at 4 26 20 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534650/94977082-152c5b00-04cc-11eb-9a35-85d4124812e5.png)\r\n\r\nHere is what the deploy preview link that is generated looks like _(sans my full Netlify hosting URL)_: `landings-landing-page-deploy-preview-links`. What I would expect is to receive a preview link that looks like: `landings/landing-page-deploy-preview-links`. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that any forward slash in my `permalink` field gets turned into a dash, which is what's used inside of the preview link. \r\n\r\nHere is what the full markdown file looks like:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\nlayout: layouts/landing.html\r\ntitle: Landing page deploy preview links\r\npermalink: landings/landing-page-deploy-preview-links/\r\nheading:\r\n  headline: Landing page deploy preview links\r\n  option: short\r\nlandingContent:\r\n  content: TEst content\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Applicable Versions:**\r\n -
