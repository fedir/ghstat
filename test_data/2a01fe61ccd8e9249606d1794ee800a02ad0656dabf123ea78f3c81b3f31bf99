\n\n[Designer Friendly Templates @ Lift](http://seventhings.liftweb.net/templates)\n\n[Building Web Applications with Lift](http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/building-web-applications-with-lift/240159451) (Dr. Dobbs)\n\n[Asta4d](https://github.com/astamuse/asta4d) => Java-based \"view-first\" web-framework, inspired by Lift, built by Astamuse  Ltd, Tokyo (Japan)\n\nBasically, \n1. a 'normal', XML-validating, [X]HTML page or fragment is parsed for specific markup/sections, either by attribute, css, or xml-namespace.  \n2. these XHTML fragments are then passed to corresponding Scala code (Snippets in [Lift](http://liftweb.net)) as arguments, where the XHTML fragment is inspected and augmented by the Snippet's instructions.  \n3. the processed XHTML fragment is replaced in the originating document.  \n4. The above promotes 'separation of concerns' and allows (enforces) the visual template(s) to be developed independently of [testable] code.\n\nI think that Widok's reactive nature would really compliment this way of composing applications. For the purpose of SPA's (Single Page Applications), the build process might be augmented to include the XHTML pages/fragments into a single code deliverable (routing internally to named fragments). \n\nTo give a little background, I'm not a web UX dev, moreover, I don't _think_ like a web dev, so, using markup libraries like ScalaTags, HAML etc. for HTML is not intuitive to me i.e. how do I mix it with normal HTML templates, for example?. However, I do like the RX/Reactive nature of Widok, it is easier to understand than React or Angular, and I want to create SPA's, [Lift](http://liftweb.net) is client server in nature.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/105","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/105/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/105/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/105/events","html_url":"https://github.com/widok/widok/issues/105","id":116994478,"number":105,"title":"DeltaBuffer to Table conversion","user":{"login":"mkotsbak","id":296523,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/296523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkotsbak","html_url":"https://github.com/mkotsbak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkotsbak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkotsbak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkotsbak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkotsbak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkotsbak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkotsbak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkotsbak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkotsbak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkotsbak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-11-15T14:15:21Z","updated_at":"2015-11-15T19:19:20Z","closed_at":"2015-11-15T19:19:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A DeltaBuffer[Row] should be implicit converted to Widget[Row] as for lists.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/100","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/100/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/100/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/100/events","html_url":"https://github.com/widok/widok/issues/100","id":108005464,"number":100,"title":"CSSStyles backed by BufSet don't honor order ","user":{"login":"bs76","id":5235784,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5235784?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bs76","html_url":"https://github.com/bs76","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bs76/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bs76/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bs76/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bs76/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bs76/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bs76/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bs76/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bs76/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bs76/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-09-23T21:02:08Z","updated_at":"2015-09-26T12:37:00Z","closed_at":"2015-09-25T22:00:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When adding styles, they are not kept in any specific order, which may cause broken styling\n\nThis causes problems with frameworks that ordered styles e.g. Semantic-UI, where elements with classes 'ten wide' are rendered ok, but 'wide ten' are not.

ld you recommend implementing a wizard flow of views, where each asks for some information and might depend on the previous wizard steps? \nI guess multiple pages with router would be noisy with the data\nSo maybe a page with widgets for each steps that are hidden with show(). But then they all would be in the dom? \nAnd all rendering that depends on the previous steps would need to be reactive\n\n@mkotsbak Yes, that's exactly what I had in mind too. You could just cache the last query and create a diff against it.\n@mkotsbak Last time I implemented a wizard, I did it with show() as you suggested:\nval step = Var(1)\n\ndef step1(): Widget[_] = ???\ndef step2(): Widget[_] = ???\ndef step3(): Widget[_] = ???\n\ndef body() = Inline(\n  step1().show(step.is(1))\n, step2().show(step.is(2))\n, step3().show(step.is(3))\n)\nIt may be interesting to extend the router for this, so that we could listen to the step number without actually re-rendering the entire page.\nAll of the widgets are in the DOM, but this is not a big deal, I think.\nHowever, if you want to load the widgets lazily, you can do it like this: \nstep.is(1).map {\n  case true => step1()\n  case false => span()\n}\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/75","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/75/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/75/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/issues/75/events","html_url":"https://github.com/widok/widok/issues/75","id":87967063,"number":75,"title":"update or clear","user":{"login":"freewind","id":333781,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/333781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freewind","html_url":"https://github.com/freewind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freewind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freewind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freewind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freewind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freewind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freewind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freewind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freewind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freewind/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/widok/widok/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/widok/widok/milestones/3/labels","id":822415,"number":3,"title":"v0.3","description":"","creator":{"login":"tindzk","id":196819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/196819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tindzk","html_url":"https://github.com/tindzk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tindzk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tindzk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tindzk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tindzk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tindzk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tindzk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tindzk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tindzk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tindzk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":6,"closed_issues":2,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-10-11T18:45:15Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T18:32:36Z","due_on":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-06-13T09:06:17Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T18:32:37Z","closed_at":"2015-07-30T18:32:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"```\nval selectedProject = Opt[Project]()\n\nselectedProject.update(p => DataStore.findProject(p.id).orElse(DataStore.firstProject).orNull)\n```\n\nI want to update the value of an `Opt`, but in some case `clear` it.

the google group thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/widok-framework/j8pR5OD5RFU\n\nWould it be feasible to add a resolve argument to the Route class?\n\n```\ncase class Route[A](path: String, page: () => Page, resolve: Option[(Seq[String]) => Future[A]])\n\n// or add a new type:\ncase class ResolvableRoute[A](path: String, page: () => Page, resolve: Option[(Seq[String]) => Future[A]])\n```\n\nThe resolve function takes the route parameters as argument (Seq[String]) and return a Future[A] that is the resolved data.\n\nThe router will not execute the route change until the resolve-future is successfully completed. The resolved data would then be passed to the targets page \"ready function\" along with the route params:\n\n```\ntrait ResolvablePage[A] extends Page {\n  def ready(route: InstantiatedRoute, resolved: A): Unit\n}\n```\n\nThis should remove dom-flickering when the target page is rendered \"empty\" and when data is initially fetched/inserted.\n\nWhat do you think?
