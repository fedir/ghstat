host & port to use ourselves.\n\nIn PR #1150, I switched to using 127.0.0.10 rather than 127.0.0.1\nfor the test server started by Test::TCP to pick a free port on,\nbecause we were getting some spurious test failures due to a race\ncondition - Test::TCP would pick a free port using Net::EmptyPort, but by the\ntime the test app had started and tried to bind to it, something else got it\ninstead.\n\nThat doesn't work on FreeBSD and possibly others, thuough - they only have\n127.0.0.1/32 on the loopback interface by default, not 127/8.\n\nSo, work out for ourselves whether to use an IP unlikely to have any ports in\nuse if we can, and 127.0.0.1 otherwise, and pick an available port using the\nport 0 trick (request port 0, let the OS pick an available port for us).\n\nTODO: this may need to be made more generic and shared with other tests.\n\nTODO: this test is failing - check if it's down to my work here or something\nelse.\n\nTODO right now: go to
