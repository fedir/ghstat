bug or enhancement\r\n\r\nOur project has editor screens with many components: labels, text fields etc. Currently we have big performance problems with opening such screens.\r\nRoot of the problem is autowiring web components to the spring context, introduced in the ticket https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba/issues/1351 \r\n\r\nFor example in our case method WebUiComponents#create() is executed approx. 300 times (which leads to the autowiring 300 beans -  WebUiComponents#autowireContext) during the screen components loading, increasing time by 714 ms according to the perfstat logs and visualVm:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6366861/95075187-d511e600-0720-11eb-9f2b-a0ae82b43288.png)\r\n\r\nAlso to prove that this is a huge problem for us, i've attached a .nps snapshot ([autowireProblem.zip](https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba/files/5327116/autowireProblem.zip) captured using jvisualvm) from the test environment during performance test execution (opening main window and editor multiple times with several threads were performed).\r\n\r\nIn this snapshot you can see that the 6 sec from the 12 (snapshot time) cpu is spend executing create() method\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6366861/95075673-a9dbc680-0721-11eb-97e5-ac7a979e6675.png)\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
