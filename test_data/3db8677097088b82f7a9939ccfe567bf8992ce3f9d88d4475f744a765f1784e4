are currently working on a project using backbone. We have run into the issue where we need to synchronize models in real time across multiple users. We are not using a backend - backbone is only used as a utility to create Models and Collections. The problem is that at the moment a Model gets created at one users machine with a particular cid which we use to identify it later (in collections etc). Unfortunately when the model's JSON representation is sent over the network to another user and it is instantiated as a Model instance on his machine a new cid is generated by backbone which causes the two users enviroments to be desyncronized. Is there a way to tell backbone to use a particular cid when creating a model? I know that I can manually change it after model creation but that breaks our app's flow in terms of event listeners not being able to identify the model properly.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any

guys,\r\n\r\nAccording to the docs, the **error** event would have a callback function with the following signature:\r\n`\"error\" (model_or_collection, response, options)`\r\nBut instead, the signature looks more like so:\r\n`\"error\" (model_or_collection, xhr, options)`\r\n\r\nAnd i think it's the same with the **sync** event also.\r\n\r\nIs it because of the jQuery version?","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone/issues/4145","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone/issues/4145/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone/issues/4145/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jashkenas/backbone/issues/4145/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/4145","id":237575847,"number":4145,"title":"Lodash
