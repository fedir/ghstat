There's nothing wrong with using it *alongside* Hunchentoot, in fact that's the way I use it. But Snooze is web-server-agnostic: I bundle it with a function that that easily plugs in Hunchentoot and another that plugs in Clack, but you can plug in whatever you want.\r\n\r\nI also don't think @fukamachi's Caveman or @Shirakumo's Radiance fit the bill of hunchentoot-basedness, but I might be wrong on those.  I do believe it's only true of RESTAS.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fukamachi/caveman/issues/66","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fukamachi/caveman","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fukamachi/caveman/issues/66/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fukamachi/caveman/issues/66/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fukamachi/caveman/issues/66/events","html_url":"https://github.com/fukamachi/caveman/issues/66","id":95333294,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5NTMzMzI5NA==","number":66,"title":"Caveman crashes occasionally","user":{"login":"triclops200","id":343522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/343522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/triclops200","html_url":"https://github.com/triclops200","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triclops200/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triclops200/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triclops200/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triclops200/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triclops200/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triclops200/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triclops200/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triclops200/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triclops200/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2015-07-16T02:29:37Z","updated_at":"2016-09-11T04:55:37Z","closed_at":"2016-09-11T04:52:53Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Every once and a while caveman crashes with a simple stream error stating that the stream ended abruptly.
