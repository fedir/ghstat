Right now it may end up doing more syscalls than the naive copy loop when doing short (<8KiB) copies between file descriptors.\n\nThe test case executes the following:\n\n```\n[pid 103776] statx(3, \"\", AT_STATX_SYNC_AS_STAT|AT_EMPTY_PATH, STATX_ALL, {stx_mask=STATX_ALL|STATX_MNT_ID, stx_attributes=0, stx_mode=S_IFREG|0644, stx_size=17, ...}) = 0\n[pid 103776] write(4, \"wxyz\", 4)        = 4\n[pid 103776] write(4, \"iklmn\", 5)       = 5\n[pid 103776] copy_file_range(3, NULL, 4, NULL, 5, 0) = 5\n\n```\n\n0-1 `stat` calls to identify the source file type. 0 if the type can be inferred from the struct from which the FD was extracted\n𝖬 `write` to drain the `BufReader`/`BufWriter` wrappers. only happen when buffers are present. 𝖬 ≾ number of wrappers present. If there is a write buffer it may absorb the read buffer contents first so only result in a single write. Vectored writes would also be an option but that would require more invasive changes to `BufWriter`.\n𝖭 `copy_file_range`/`splice`/`sendfile` until file size, EOF or the byte limit from `Take` is reached. This should generally be *much* more efficient than the read-write loop and also have other benefits such as DMA offload or extent sharing.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\n```\n\nOLD\n\ntest

This is the reason it was removed from the standard library in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37229 .\n\nBecause regardless of which dimension you value, there are better alternatives, it does not make sense for anyone to consider using `fnv`.\n\nThe text mentioning `fnv` in the standard library continues to create confusion: https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/153  https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/9 . There are also a number of [crates using it](https://crates.io/crates/fnv/reverse_dependencies) a great many of which are hashing strings (Which is when Fnv is the [worst](https://github.com/cbreeden/fxhash#benchmarks), [possible](https://github.com/tkaitchuck/aHash#speed), [choice](http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/hash-rs/).)\n\nI think aHash makes the most sense to mention as an alternative because it is the most credible option (in my obviously biased opinion). It offers [good performance on numbers and strings](https://github.com/tkaitchuck/aHash/blob/master/compare/readme.md#speed), is [of high quality](https://github.com/tkaitchuck/aHash#hash-quality), and [provides dos resistance](https://github.com/tkaitchuck/aHash/wiki/How-aHash-is-resists-DOS-attacks).

This is the reason it was removed from the standard library in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37229 .\n\nBecause regardless of which dimension you value, there are better alternatives, it does not make sense for anyone to consider using `fnv`.\n\nThe text mentioning `fnv` in the standard library continues to create confusion: https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/153  https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/9 . There are also a number of [crates using it](https://crates.io/crates/fnv/reverse_dependencies) a great many of which are hashing strings (Which is when Fnv is the [worst](https://github.com/cbreeden/fxhash#benchmarks), [possible](https://github.com/tkaitchuck/aHash#speed), [choice](http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/hash-rs/).)\n\nI think aHash makes the most sense to mention as an alternative because it is the most credible option (in my obviously biased opinion).
