This change increases memory usage somewhat, but permits a\nmuch faster algorithm to be used:\n\n- If one scope has a greater depth than the other, the deeper scope is\n  moved upward until they are at equal depths.\n\n- Then we move the two scopes upward in lockstep until they match.\n\nThis avoids the need to keep track of which scopes have already been\nseen, which was the major part of the cost of the old algorithm. It also\nreduces the number of child-to-parent moves (which are hash table\nlookups) when the scopes start at different levels, because it never\ngoes past the nearest common ancestor the way the old algorithm did.\n\nFinally, the case where one of the scopes is the root is now handled in\nadvance, because that is moderately common and lets us skip everything.\n\nThis change speeds up runs of several rust-perf benchmarks, the best by\n6%.\n\nA selection of the bigger improvements:\n```\nclap-rs-check\n        avg: -2.6%      min: -6.6%      max: 0.0%\nsyn-check\n        avg: -2.2%      min: -5.0%      max: 0.0%\nstyle-servo-check\n        avg: -2.9%?     min: -4.8%?     max: 0.0%?\ncargo-check\n        avg: -1.3%      min: -2.8%      max: 0.0%\nsentry-cli-check\n        avg: -1.0%      min: -2.1%      max: 0.0%\nwebrender-check\n        avg: -0.9%      min: -2.0%      max: 0.0%\nstyle-servo\n        avg: -0.9%?     min: -1.8%?     max: -0.0%?\nripgrep-check\n        avg: -0.7%      min: -1.8%      max: 0.1%\nclap-rs\n        avg: -0.9%      min: -1.6%      max: -0.2%\nregex-check\n        avg: -0.2%      min: -1.3%      max: 0.1%\nsyn\n        avg: -0.6%      min: -1.3%      max: 0.1%\nhyper-check\n        avg: -0.5%      min: -1.1%      max: 0.0%\n```\nThe idea came from multiple commenters on my blog and on Reddit.
