The flag has two effects:\n\n * The NameAnonGlobal pass is run after all other passes, which ensures that all globals have a name.\n * In optimized builds, a number of late passes (mainly related to vectorization and unrolling) are disabled, on the rationale that these a) will increase codesize of the intermediate artifacts and b) will be run by ThinLTO again anyway.\n\nThis patch enables the use of PrepareForThinLTO if Thin or ThinLocal linking is used.\n\nThe background for this change is the CI failure in #49479, which we assume to be caused by the NameAnonGlobal pass not being run. As this changes which passes LLVM runs, this might have performance (or other) impact, so we want to land this separately.","tree":{"sha":"26403b7bfa1eadbb59b4debf8529bb1779d3c063","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/26403b7bfa1eadbb59b4debf8529bb1779d3c063"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/c0cea750a0a10a0ed5a101839e37968d87f8ef9d","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/c0cea750a0a10a0ed5a101839e37968d87f8ef9d","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c0cea750a0a10a0ed5a101839e37968d87f8ef9d","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/c0cea750a0a10a0ed5a101839e37968d87f8ef9d/comments","author":{"login":"bors","id":3372342,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors","html_url":"https://github.com/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"bors","id":3372342,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors","html_url":"https://github.com/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"e6db79f2ca07e4e533f4e940462a42f1093e52f3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/e6db79f2ca07e4e533f4e940462a42f1093e52f3","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/e6db79f2ca07e4e533f4e940462a42f1093e52f3"},{"sha":"a70ef4cb49295563a09b254de4751c016c79e262","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/a70ef4cb49295563a09b254de4751c016c79e262","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a70ef4cb49295563a09b254de4751c016c79e262"}]},{"sha":"da79ff3cc2265514483d2a5e1f4238c85baa70e9","commit":{"author":{"name":"Alex Crichton","email":"alex@alexcrichton.com","date":"2018-05-11T18:31:08Z"},"committer":{"name":"Mark Simulacrum","email":"mark.simulacrum@gmail.com","date":"2018-05-12T14:39:05Z"},"message":"rustc: Only suggest deleting `extern crate` if it works\n\nThis commit updates one of the edition lints to only suggest deleting `extern\ncrate` if it actually works.
