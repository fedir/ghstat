Note that we *do not* catch the error, if one is\r\nthrown. But, we only unset the flag after the callback successfully\r\nfinishes.\r\n\r\nIf we reach the 'finally' block and the flag was not unset, then it\r\nmeans an error was thrown.\r\n\r\nIn that case we start a new postMessage callback, to finish calling any\r\nother pending callbacks if there is time.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nWe need to make sure that an error thrown from one callback doesn't stop\r\nother callbacks from firing, but we also don't want to catch or swallow\r\nthe error because we want engineers to still be able to log and debug\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nNew tests added are passing, and we verified that they fail without this\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n* Add more tests for error handling in scheduler\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nAdded tests for more situations where error handling may come up.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nTo get additional protection against this being broken in the future.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nRan new tests and verified that they fail when error handling fails.\r\n\r\n* callSafely -> callUnsafely\r\n\r\n* Fix bugs with error handling in schedule\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\n- ensure that we properly remove the callback from the linked list, even\r\nif it throws an error and is timed out.\r\n- ensure that you can call 'cancelScheduledWork' more than once and it\r\nis idempotent.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nTo fix bugs :)\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nExisting tests pass, and we'll add more tests in a follow up commit.\r\n\r\n* Unit tests for error handling with timed out callbacks\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nMore unit tests, to cover behavior which we missed; error handling of\r\ntimed out callbacks.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nTo protect the future!~\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nRun the new tests.\r\n\r\n* Adds fixture to test timed out callbacks with scheduler\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nSee title\r\n\r\nIn the other error handling fixture we compare 'scheduleWork' error\r\nhandling to 'requestAnimationFrame' and try to get as close as possible.\r\nThere is no 'timing out' feature with 'requestAnimationFrame' but\r\neffectively the 'timing out' feature changes the order in which things\r\nare called. So we just changed the order in the 'requestAnimationFrame'\r\nversion and that works well for illustrating the behavior we expect in\r\nthe 'scheduleWork' test.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nWe need more test coverage of timed out callbacks.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nExecuted the fixture manually in Firefox and Chrome. Results looked\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n* fix rebase problems\r\n\r\n* make fixture compensate for chrome JS speed\r\n\r\n* ran prettier\r\n\r\n* Remove 'cancelled' flag on callbackConfig in scheduler, add test\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\n- Instead of using a 'cancelled' flag on the callbackConfig, it's easier\r\nto just check the state of the callbackConfig inside\r\n'cancelScheduledWork' to determine if it's already been cancelled. That\r\nway we don't have to remember to set the 'cancelled' flag every time we\r\ncall a callback or cancel it. One less thing to remember.\r\n- We added a test for calling 'cancelScheduledWork' more than once,\r\nwhich would have failed before.\r\n\r\nThanks @acdlite for suggesting this in code review. :)\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nTo increase stability of the schedule module, increase test coverage.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nExisting tests pass and we added a new test to cover this behavior.\r\n\r\n* fix typo","tree":{"sha":"4372f53dcc6a12194bc9eace4912ac998d178f10","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/trees/4372f53dcc6a12194bc9eace4912ac998d178f10"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/15767a8f8f798f0d80df4ddbc7cfaebdc29996a8","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":true,"reason":"valid","signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\nwsBcBAABCAAQBQJbDyf4CRBK7hj4Ov3rIwAAdHIIABBPgn6Qco7T/BqncfQK2Nyl\nS0z16jLpmpI5v5jGlidpH98K4MFdhIafCpRqNFijyMgm4HIIln7TMBXpTlt93h40\ngukJ2FLOn2IxsztcqP20g3EsfoyUeRv0Xbf+aQQ96RvshjZ4DzFl1+QwyL/xTU92\noZFan/HhQhQH3rIKrg00Y+Ykn4vs7fURa7Vr4TjZvKcs5YGkoUUvsFnxijqAKIxZ\nGeRrRJ0gIE+tX0HEYrpkv7sLXojzNw0Fjm9SQterhktAe1LHOLWFhifVx71+tmgA\nT809kyiDxgaDTkdZtQfd2VtripI4ZR6h263e6Gl0pOk/ijzBH0jirmt/Z5RZlvo=\n=JpeU\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n","payload":"tree 4372f53dcc6a12194bc9eace4912ac998d178f10\nparent 3118ed9d640ad28af306de308301f4fcd029ffca\nauthor Flarnie Marchan <flarnie@users.noreply.github.com> 1527719928 -0700\ncommitter GitHub <noreply@github.com> 1527719928 -0700\n\n[scheduler] 5/n Error handling in scheduler (#12920)\n\n* Initial failing unit test for error handling in schedule\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nsee title\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nAdding tests for the error handling behavior we are about to add.

But, we only unset the flag after the callback successfully\r\nfinishes.\r\n\r\nIf we reach the 'finally' block and the flag was not unset, then it\r\nmeans an error was thrown.\r\n\r\nIn that case we start a new postMessage callback, to finish calling any\r\nother pending callbacks if there is time.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nWe need to make sure that an error thrown from one callback doesn't stop\r\nother callbacks from firing, but we also don't want to catch or swallow\r\nthe error because we want engineers to still be able to log and debug\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nNew tests added are passing, and we verified that they fail without this\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n* Add more tests for error handling in scheduler\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nAdded tests for more situations where error handling may come up.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nTo get additional protection against this being broken in the future.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nRan new tests and verified that they fail when error handling fails.\r\n\r\n* callSafely -> callUnsafely\r\n\r\n* Fix bugs with error handling in schedule\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\n- ensure that we properly remove the callback from the linked list, even\r\nif it throws an error and is timed out.\r\n- ensure that you can call 'cancelScheduledWork' more than once and it\r\nis idempotent.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nTo fix bugs :)\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nExisting tests pass, and we'll add more tests in a follow up commit.\r\n\r\n* Unit tests for error handling with timed out callbacks\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nMore unit tests, to cover behavior which we missed; error handling of\r\ntimed out callbacks.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nTo protect the future!~\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nRun the new tests.\r\n\r\n* Adds fixture to test timed out callbacks with scheduler\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\nSee title\r\n\r\nIn the other error handling fixture we compare 'scheduleWork' error\r\nhandling to 'requestAnimationFrame' and try to get as close as possible.\r\nThere is no 'timing out' feature with 'requestAnimationFrame' but\r\neffectively the 'timing out' feature changes the order in which things\r\nare called. So we just changed the order in the 'requestAnimationFrame'\r\nversion and that works well for illustrating the behavior we expect in\r\nthe 'scheduleWork' test.\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nWe need more test coverage of timed out callbacks.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nExecuted the fixture manually in Firefox and Chrome. Results looked\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n* fix rebase problems\r\n\r\n* make fixture compensate for chrome JS speed\r\n\r\n* ran prettier\r\n\r\n* Remove 'cancelled' flag on callbackConfig in scheduler, add test\r\n\r\n**what is the change?:**\r\n- Instead of using a 'cancelled' flag on the callbackConfig, it's easier\r\nto just check the state of the callbackConfig inside\r\n'cancelScheduledWork' to determine if it's already been cancelled. That\r\nway we don't have to remember to set the 'cancelled' flag every time we\r\ncall a callback or cancel it. One less thing to remember.\r\n- We added a test for calling 'cancelScheduledWork' more than once,\r\nwhich would have failed before.\r\n\r\nThanks @acdlite for suggesting this in code review. :)\r\n\r\n**why make this change?:**\r\nTo increase stability of the schedule module, increase test coverage.\r\n\r\n**test plan:**\r\nExisting tests pass and we added a new test to cover this behavior.\r\n\r\n* fix typo\r\n"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/commits/15767a8f8f798f0d80df4ddbc7cfaebdc29996a8","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/15767a8f8f798f0d80df4ddbc7cfaebdc29996a8","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/commits/15767a8f8f798f0d80df4ddbc7cfaebdc29996a8/comments","author":{"login":"flarnie","id":1114467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1114467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flarnie","html_url":"https://github.com/flarnie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flarnie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flarnie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flarnie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flarnie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flarnie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flarnie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flarnie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flarnie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flarnie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"3118ed9d640ad28af306de308301f4fcd029ffca","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/commits/3118ed9d640ad28af306de308301f4fcd029ffca","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/3118ed9d640ad28af306de308301f4fcd029ffca"}]},{"sha":"3118ed9d640ad28af306de308301f4fcd029ffca","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTAyNzAyNTA6MzExOGVkOWQ2NDBhZDI4YWYzMDZkZTMwODMwMWY0ZmNkMDI5ZmZjYQ==","commit":{"author":{"name":"Andrew
