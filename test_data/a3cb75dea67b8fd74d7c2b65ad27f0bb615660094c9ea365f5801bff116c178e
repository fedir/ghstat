(#12600)\n\n* Decouple update queue from Fiber type\r\n\r\nThe update queue is in need of a refactor. Recent bugfixes (#12528) have\r\nexposed some flaws in how it's modeled. Upcoming features like Suspense\r\nand [redacted] also rely on the update queue in ways that weren't\r\nanticipated in the original design.\r\n\r\nMajor changes:\r\n\r\n- Instead of boolean flags for `isReplace` and `isForceUpdate`, updates\r\nhave a `tag` field (like Fiber). This lowers the cost for adding new\r\ntypes of updates.\r\n- Render phase updates are special cased.
