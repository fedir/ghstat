This\ncheck triggers the assertion for proxy-ish objects to use `get` rather\nthan installed es5-getter so we add a special case to allow it.\n\nPrior to this change when you called `off` on the proxyish object it\nwould trigger an assertion telling you to call\n`eventedProxyObj.get('didRemoveListener') rather than\n`eventedProxyObj.didRemoveListener`.\n\nA few notes about this test:\n\n- the unknownProperty is how we let ember know this is a proxy\n- the unknownProperty function must return a value other than undefined\n- Evented Mixin must be mixed in
