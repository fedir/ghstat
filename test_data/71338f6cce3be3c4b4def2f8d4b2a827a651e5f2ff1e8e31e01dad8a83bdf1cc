beta] revert jquery-less pendingRequest event handling\n\nIn general,Ember's testing system leverages `ajaxSend` and\n`ajaxComplete` events to know when `jQuery.ajax` requests are pending\n(and it should therefore \"pause settledness\" of the testing helpers like\n`click` / `andThen` / etc).\n\nIn the Ember 3.1 cycle Ember changed from using `jQuery.on` to\n`document.addEventListener` to subscribe to these events. Unfortunately,\n`jQuery.ajax` **does not** trigger listeners added in this way (we would\nhave had to do `document.onajaxSend = function() { /* stuff here */ }`).\nThe result of this change is that \"normal\" acceptance testing helpers\nwill _no longer_ be able to detect and wait for pending `jQuery.ajax`.\n\nSo, for example, you might expect that given the following\n\n```js\nawait click('#some-selector');\n\nassert.equal(\n   $('#something-that-should-exist-after-an-ajax-call').text(),\n   'hi'\n);\n```\n\nthe click helper would wait until `jQuery.ajax` calls were settled\nbefore the assertion, but prior to the changes in this commit\nthe promise returned by `click` would **not** wait until the\n`jQuery.ajax` request was completed and therefore the assertion would\nfail.\n\n---\n\nThis commit reverts the changes to use `document.addEventListener` back\nto using `jQuery.on` directly when `jQuery` is available.\n\nMany bothans died to bring us this information. :sob: :cry: :crying_cat:\n\nPaired with @rwjblue to resolve this
