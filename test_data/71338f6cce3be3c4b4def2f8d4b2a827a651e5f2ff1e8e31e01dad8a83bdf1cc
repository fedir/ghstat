Use customized dasherization for angle bracket invocations.\n\nThe [Angle Bracket Invocation\nRFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.md#tag-name)\nspecifically states:\n\n> The tag name will be normalized using the dasherize function, which is\n> the same rules used by existing use cases, such as service injections.\n> This allows existing components to be invoked by the new syntax.\n\nUnfortunately, using `Ember.String.dasherize` has (IMHO) fatal\nconsequences for angle bracket invocation.  Specifically, for an angle\nbracket invocation as `<XFoo />` using `Ember.String.dasherize` we would\nlook up `xfoo` which IMHO is fundamentally flawed...\n\nChanging `Ember.String.dasherize` has very wide spread impact, and is\nlikely to break existing apps in subtle ways. This implements a much\nsimpler dasherization system used exclusively for component lookup (with\nits own independent cache).","tree":{"sha":"cfc05d69051296be75b3cdad19505169c42b00ea","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/git/trees/cfc05d69051296be75b3cdad19505169c42b00ea"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/git/commits/39cad247deace4f6fbfffe7f1c464b28639bcc47","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/commits/39cad247deace4f6fbfffe7f1c464b28639bcc47","html_url":"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/commit/39cad247deace4f6fbfffe7f1c464b28639bcc47","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/commits/39cad247deace4f6fbfffe7f1c464b28639bcc47/comments","author":{"login":"rwjblue","id":12637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rwjblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"rwjblue","id":12637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rwjblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwjblue/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"1bdb940cb5070d2d49fefcf27e4a931aa7c02c53","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/commits/1bdb940cb5070d2d49fefcf27e4a931aa7c02c53","html_url":"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/commit/1bdb940cb5070d2d49fefcf27e4a931aa7c02c53"}]},{"sha":"b0488cc45962c3ed0980269fd052ad18145de995","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTgwMTgyOTpiMDQ4OGNjNDU5NjJjM2VkMDk4MDI2OWZkMDUyYWQxODE0NWRlOTk1","commit":{"author":{"name":"bekzod","email":"bekzod@me.com","date":"2018-06-04T07:44:13Z"},"committer":{"name":"bekzod","email":"bekzod@me.com","date":"2018-06-04T08:44:30Z"},"message":"cleanup `toBool`","tree":{"sha":"7566192f76ad7066679267d7a96cc5ed9eed1a1a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/git/trees/7566192f76ad7066679267d7a96cc5ed9eed1a1a"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/git/commits/b0488cc45962c3ed0980269fd052ad18145de995","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/commits/b0488cc45962c3ed0980269fd052ad18145de995","html_url":"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/commit/b0488cc45962c3ed0980269fd052ad18145de995","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/commits/b0488cc45962c3ed0980269fd052ad18145de995/comments","author":{"login":"bekzod","id":1131614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzE2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1131614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bekzod","html_url":"https://github.com/bekzod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bekzod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bekzod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bekzod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bekzod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/u
