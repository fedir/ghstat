infinite rerenders when errors occur during render\n\nThis adds a preventative measure against infinite rerenders that happen\ndue to an unrecoverable error during rendering. This type of error is\nreally annoying from a DX perspective and can really throw developers\nfor a loop. The most common cases appear to be caused by the Ember\nInspector, which polls after a render has occured whether on not it was\nsuccesful, and in doing so also dirties state, causing a rerender.\n\nAn example of this is seen in this [example reproduction](https://github.com/xg-wang/getter-error)\nwith the following steps:\n\n1. Load the app\n2. Click the To View link to enter the page with the error\n3. Open up the Ember Inspector to activate it\n4.
