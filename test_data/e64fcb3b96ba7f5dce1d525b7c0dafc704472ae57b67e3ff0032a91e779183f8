The main way such imports can arise is when\na component would ordinarily reference its dependencies in its component\ndefinition `directiveDefs` and `pipeDefs`. This requires adding imports,\nwhich run the risk of creating a cycle.\n\nWhen ngtsc detects that adding such an import would cause this to occur, it\ninstead falls back on a strategy called \"remote scoping\", where a side-\neffectful call to `setComponentScope` in the component's NgModule file is\nused to patch `directiveDefs` and `pipeDefs` onto the component. Since the\nNgModule file already imports all of the component's dependencies (to\ndeclare them in the NgModule), this approach does not risk adding a cycle.\nIt has several large downsides, however:\n\n1. it breaks under `sideEffects: false` logic in bundlers including the CLI\n2. it breaks tree-shaking for the given component and its dependencies\n\nSee this doc for further details: https://hackmd.io/Odw80D0pR6yfsOjg_7XCJg?view\n\nIn particular, the impact on tree-shaking was exacerbated by the naive logic\nngtsc used to employ here. When this feature was implemented, at the time of\ngenerating the side-effectful `setComponentScope` call, the compiler did not\nknow which of the component's declared dependencies were actually used in\nits template. This meant that unlike the generation of `directiveDefs` in\nthe component definition itself, `setComponentScope` calls had to list the\n_entire_ compilation scope of the component's NgModule, including directives\nand pipes which were not actually used in the template. This made the tree-\nshaking impact much worse, since if the component's NgModule made use of any\nshared NgModules (e.g. `CommonModule`), every declaration therein would\nbecome un-treeshakable.\n\nToday, ngtsc does have the information on which directives/pipes are\nactually used in the template, but this was not being used during the remote\nscoping operation. This commit modifies remote scoping to take advantage of\nthe extra context and only list used dependencies in `setComponentScope`\ncalls, which should ameliorate the tree-shaking impact somewhat.\n\nPR Close

ViewContainerRef nodes when inside root of a component (#39599)\n\nWhen a `ViewContainerRef` is injected, we dynamically create a comment node next to the host\nso that it can be used as an anchor point for inserting views. The comment node is inserted\nthrough the `appendChild` helper from `node_manipulation.ts` in most cases.\n\nThe problem with using `appendChild` here is that it has some extra logic which doesn't return\na parent `RNode` if an element is at the root of a component. I __think__ that this is a performance\noptimization which is used to avoid inserting an element in one place in the DOM and then\nmoving it a bit later when it is projected. This can break down in some cases when creating\na `ViewContainerRef` for a non-component node at the root of another component like the following:\n\n```\n<root>\n  <div #viewContainerRef></div>\n</root>\n```\n\nIn this case the `#viewContainerRef` node is at the root of a component so we intentionally don't\ninsert it, but since its anchor element was created manually, it'll never be projected. This will\nprevent any views added through the `ViewContainerRef` from being inserted into the DOM.\n\nThese changes resolve the issue by not going through `appendChild` at all when creating a comment\nnode for `ViewContainerRef`. This should work identically since `appendChild` doesn't really do\nanything with the T structures anyway, it only uses them to reach the relevant DOM nodes.\n\nFixes #39556.\n\nPR Close #39599","tree":{"sha":"966638d431307fbe50127869608200698e4bef10","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/git/trees/966638d431307fbe50127869608200698e4bef10"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/git/commits/b015d3e9505b530bff1f4a0424394a785a013a0a","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/commits/b015d3e9505b530bff1f4a0424394a785a013a0a","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/b015d3e9505b530bff1f4a0424394a785a013a0a","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/commits/b015d3e9505b530bff1f4a0424394a785a013a0a/comments","author":{"login":"crisbeto","id":4450522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTA1MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4450522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crisbeto","html_url":"https://github.com/crisbeto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crisbeto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crisbeto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crisbeto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crisbeto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crisbeto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crisbeto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crisbeto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crisbeto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crisbeto/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"atscott","id":479713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTcxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/479713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atscott","html_url":"https://github.com/atscott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atscott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atscott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atscott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atscott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atscott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atscott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atscott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atscott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atscott/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"1bc53eb303435e34d292ad4ea2e7c5bfccfa7527","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/commits/1bc53eb303435e34d292ad4ea2e7c5bfccfa7527","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/1bc53eb303435e34d292ad4ea2e7c5bfccfa7527"}]},{"sha":"1bc53eb303435e34d292ad4ea2e7c5bfccfa7527","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjQxOTUzMzk6MWJjNTNlYjMwMzQzNWUzNGQyOTJhZDRlYTJlN2M1YmZjY2ZhNzUyNw==","commit":{"author":{"name":"Andrew Kushnir","email":"akushnir@google.com","date":"2020-11-10T06:58:19Z"},"committer":{"name":"atscott","email":"atscott01@gmail.com","date":"2020-11-12T17:38:19Z"},"message":"fix(forms): more precise control cleanup (#39623)\n\nCurrently when an instance of the `FormControlName` directive is destroyed, the Forms package invokes\nthe `cleanUpControl` to clear all directive-specific logic (such as validators, onChange handlers,\netc) from a bound control. The logic of the `cleanUpControl` function should revert all setup\nperformed by the `setUpControl` function. However the `cleanUpControl` is too aggressive and removes\nall callbacks related to the onChange and disabled state handling. This is causing problems when\na form control is bound to multiple FormControlName` directives, causing other instances of that\ndirective to stop working correctly when the first one is destroyed.\n\nThis commit updates the cleanup logic to only remove callbacks added while setting up a control\nfor a given directive instance.\n\nThe fix is needed to allow adding `cleanUpControl` function to other places where cleanup is needed\n(missing this function calls in some other places causes memory leak issues).\n\nPR Close
