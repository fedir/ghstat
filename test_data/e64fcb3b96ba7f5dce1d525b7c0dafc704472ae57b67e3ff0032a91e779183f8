bug (#23379)\n\nThe issue is with tsickle type inference and the bug should be assigned to them.\n\nThe offending code is:\n```\nfunction cacheMatchingDirectivesForNode(\n    tNode: TNode, tView: TView, localRefs: string[] | null): void {\n  const exportsMap = localRefs ? {'': -1} : null;     // <<<<< ===== OFFENDING LINE\n  const matches = tView.currentMatches = findDirectiveMatches(tNode);\n  if (matches) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < matches.length; i += 2) {\n      const def = matches[i] as DirectiveDef<any>;\n      const valueIndex = i + 1;\n      resolveDirective(def, valueIndex, matches, tView);\n      saveNameToExportMap(matches[valueIndex] as number, def, exportsMap);\n    }\n  }\n  if (exportsMap) cacheMatchingLocalNames(tNode, localRefs, exportsMap);\n}\n\n```\n\nbecause it generates invalid js closure code:\n```\nfunction cacheMatchingDirectivesForNode(tNode, tView, localRefs) {\n    const /** @type {(null|{: number})} */ exportsMap = localRefs ? { '': -1 } : null;      // <<<<< ===== OFFENDING LINE\n    const /** @type {(null|!Array<?>)} */ matches = tView.currentMatches = findDirectiveMatches(tNode);\n    if (matches) {\n        for (let /** @type {number} */ i = 0; i < matches.length; i += 2) {\n            const /** @type {!tsickle_forward_declare_11.DirectiveDef<?>} */ def = /** @type {!tsickle_forward_declare_11.DirectiveDef<?>} */ (matches[i]);\n            const /** @type {number} */ valueIndex = i + 1;\n            resolveDirective(def, valueIndex, matches, tView);\n            saveNameToExportMap(/** @type {number} */ (matches[valueIndex]), def, exportsMap);\n        }\n    }\n    if (exportsMap)\n        cacheMatchingLocalNames(tNode, localRefs, exportsMap);\n}\n```\n\nThe workaround is to declare the type explicitly such as:\n\n```\nconst exportsMap: ({[key:string]:number}|null) = localRefs ? {'': -1} : null;\n```\n\nwhich than generates valid closure code:\n\n```\nconst /** @type {(null|!Object<string,number>)} */ exportsMap = localRefs ? { '': -1 } : null;\n```\n\nPR Close

support for configuring navigations URLs (#23339)\n\nThe ServiceWorker will redirect navigation requests that don't match any\n`asset` or `data` group to the specified index file. The rules for a\nrequest to be classified as a navigation request are as follows:\n1. Its `mode` must be `navigation`.\n2. It must accept a `text/html` response.\n3. Its URL must match certain criteria (see below).\n\nBy default, a navigation request can have any URL except for:\n1. URLs containing `__`.\n2. URLs to files (i.e. containing a file extension in the last path\n   segment).\n\nWhile these rules are fine in many cases, sometimes it is desirable to\nconfigure different rules for the URLs of navigation requests (e.g.\nignore specific URLs and pass them through to the server).\n\nThis commit adds support for specifying an optional `navigationUrls`\nlist in `ngsw-config.json`, which contains URLs or simple globs\n(currently only recognizing `!`, `*` and `**`).\nOnly requests whose URLs match any of the positive URLs/patterns and\nnone of the negative ones (i.e. URLs/patterns starting with `!`) will be\nconsidered navigation requests (and handled accordingly by the SW).\n\n(This is an alternative implementation to #23025.)\n\nFixes #20404\n\nPR Close
