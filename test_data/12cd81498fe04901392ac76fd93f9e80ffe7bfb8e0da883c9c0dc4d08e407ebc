Better error and edge case handling in sizer.js\r\n\r\n* Fix some problematic source links in data.js\r\n\r\n* More cleanup/fixes in data.js\r\n\r\n* Use requests instead of hypervisor\r\n\r\n- hypervisor is no longer being maintained\r\n- My logs were friggin full of an annoying error even after updating to the latest version https://github.com/substack/hyperquest/issues/39\r\n\r\n* Fix one last problem link in data.js\r\n\r\n* Remove unneeded log line\r\n\r\n(I put it there a bit ago for debugging purposes and forgot to remove it before committing)\r\n\r\n* Update dependencies in package.json\r\n\r\n- Update to latest version of after (fixes an error I was getting)\r\n- Upgrade from uglify-js@2.x to uglify-es@3.x to support libraries using ES6+ syntax (old behavior was to always reject due to uglify errors)\r\n- Use request package instead of the no-longer-maintained hyperquest; remove obviated hyperquest, hyperdirect, hyperzip, and bl libraries\r\n- Errno also seems to be upgraded (this change wasn't deliberate?)\r\n\r\n* make atom.xml and data-min.js\r\n\r\n* Fix issue with github auth\r\n\r\n(hopefully)\r\n"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microjs/microjs.com/commits/27b06174d3880326ff6254484fc9fdc4dc0edcc8","html_url":"https://github.com/microjs/microjs.com/commit/27b06174d3880326ff6254484fc9fdc4dc0edcc8","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microjs/microjs.com/commits/27b06174d3880326ff6254484fc9fdc4dc0edcc8/comments","author":{"login":"pineapplemachine","id":7266412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7266412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine","html_url":"https://github.com/pineapplemachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"f5f9d7a97819a0335fbd52d82412eedc2c8519ad","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microjs/microjs.com/commits/f5f9d7a97819a0335fbd52d82412eedc2c8519ad","html_url":"https://github.com/microjs/microjs.com/commit/f5f9d7a97819a0335fbd52d82412eedc2c8519ad"}]},{"sha":"f5f9d7a97819a0335fbd52d82412eedc2c8519ad","commit":{"author":{"name":"Eduardo
