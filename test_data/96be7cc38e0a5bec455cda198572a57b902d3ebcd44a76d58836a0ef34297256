extendable, for the future, is what I saw.\n            Guten-ready for evermore.\n\nOpen here I switch to Slack, when, with many a patch and hack,\nIn there stepped Omar, a JavaScript developer hardcore;\nPronouncing all the changes fit; ready now to be commit;\n“There’s nothing else for us to do,” DMing me, “It’s done!” he swore—\n“No longer random guessing at which file need next be explored—\n            Let’s move on, we’re all aboard.”\n\nMoved all together, grouped and managed, in folders all is packaged,\nThe code had all been cleaned and tidied, important parts moved to the fore,\n“Though this change be useful here,” I said, “it is too large, I fear,\nWe couldn’t manage such a patch, we’ve done nothing like this before—\nTell me where doth go this change, change to make our codebase soar!”\n            Quoth Omar, “In WordPress Core.”\n\nProps omarreis for shepherding this significant change.\nProps adamsilverstein, aduth, atimmer, dingo_bastard, frank-klein, gziolo,

Given that, it doesn't make sense to allow users without that capability to edit or delete the page. \n\nA similar situation exists with the `page_for_posts` and `page_on_front` options, but Editors are allowed to edit those pages. The reason that this situation is different is because it is more likely that an administrator will want to restrict modifications to the privacy policy, than it is that they will want to allow modifications. Modifications to the policy often require specialized knowledge of local laws, and can have implications for compliance with those laws.\n\nProps dlh, desrosj.\nFixes #44079.\n\nBuilt from https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk@43286\n\n\ngit-svn-id: http://core.svn.wordpress.org/trunk@43115 1a063a9b-81f0-0310-95a4-ce76da25c4cd","tree":{"sha":"c0052e6977e7022bb1f37ed0f3ef5857a33824f6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WordPress/WordPress/git/trees/c0052e6977e7022bb1f37ed0f3ef5857a33824f6"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WordPress/WordPress/git/commits/461d17576c9a941d1455da8aa616a785a8e780de","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WordPress/WordPress/commits/461d17576c9a941d1455da8aa616a785a8e780de","html_url":"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/461d17576c9a941d1455da8aa616a785a8e780de","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WordPress/WordPress/commits/461d17576c9a941d1455da8aa616a785a8e780de/comments","author":{"login":"iandunn","id":484068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDA2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/484068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn","html_url":"https://github.com/iandunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"iandunn","id":484068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDA2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/484068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn","html_url":"https://github.com/iandunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iandunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"fdd5b8dacdf5f3e107747e9870c2f2db3f3481b1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WordPress/WordPress/commits/fdd5b8dacdf5f3e107747e9870c2f2db3f3481b1","html_url":"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/fdd5b8dacdf5f3e107747e9870c2f2db3f3481b1"}]},{"sha":"fdd5b8dacdf5f3e107747e9870c2f2db3f3481b1","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0Mjg4OTMyODpmZGQ1YjhkYWNkZjVmM2UxMDc3NDdlOTg3MGMyZjJkYjNmMzQ4MWIx","commit":{"author":{"name":"iandunn","email":"iandunn@git.wordpress.org","date":"2018-05-15T20:22:20Z"},"committer":{"name":"iandunn","email":"iandunn@git.wordpress.org","date":"2018-05-15T20:22:20Z"},"message":"Privacy: Rename exports folder to avoid deleting other files.\n\nPreviously, personal data exports were stored in `wp-content/uploads/exports`, which is generic enough that it's likely there are existing folders with that name, either created by plugins or manually by administrators. If that folder were reused by Core, then `wp_privacy_delete_old_export_files()` would delete all of the existing files inside it, which is almost certainly not what the site owner wants or expects.\n\nTo avoid that, the folder is being renamed to include a specific reference to Core, and a more verbose description of its purpose. With those factored in, it's very unlikely that there will be any conflicts with existing folders.\n\nThe `wp_privacy_exports_dir()` and `wp_privacy_exports_url()` functions were introduced to provide a canonical source for the location, and the `wp_privacy_exports_dir` and `wp_privacy_exports_url` filters were introduced to allow plugins to customize it.\n\nProps johnjamesjacoby, allendav.\nFixes
