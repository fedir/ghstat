Reposition pointer to ensure dismiss link is always visible.\n\nr43158 introduced a new admin pointer for the privacy tools added in 4.9.6. With the previous positioning, though, sometimes the `Dismiss` link would be fixed off screen, making it impossible for the user to dismiss the pointer. This happened when there were enough extra menu items, or when the viewport height was short enough.\n\nThis commit repositions the pointer to work around that problem. One down side of this workaround is that the arrow will not always be positioned next to the `Tools` menu, where it should be. That's an acceptable compromise given the current time constraints, though. A long term solution would be to make `WP_Pointer` robust enough to handle this use case.\n\nProps imath, audrasjb, desrosj.\nFixes #44045.\n\nBuilt from

Replace intrusive policy update notice with menu bubbles.\n\nPreviously, when a plugin updated its suggested privacy policy text, an admin notice was shown on all screens in the Administration Panels. That was done in order to make sure that administrators were aware of it, so that they could update their policy if needed. That was a very heavy-handed and intrusive approach, though, which leads to a poor user experience, and notice fatigue. \n\nAn alternative approach is to use bubble notifications in the menu, similar to when plugins have updates that need to be installed. That still makes it obvious that something needs the administrator's attention, but is not as distracting as a notice.\n\nThe notice will still appear on the Privacy page, though, since it is relevant to that screen, and provides an explanation of why the bubble is appearing.\n\nProps azaozz, xkon, iandunn.\nFixes #43954.
