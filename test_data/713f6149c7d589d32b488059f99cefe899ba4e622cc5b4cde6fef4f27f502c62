needed to use message.Embed() in one email that I was sending with two images. \r\n\r\nCurrently we can only submit message.Attach().\r\n\r\nIt was very easy to implement it, but I just wanted some recommendation on the signature of the method, for me the more logical way is to make a breaking change, I just wanted the opinion of Mark before committing my solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wanted to replace \r\n\r\n`func (m *Message) AddAttachment(name, contentType string, r io.Reader) error`\r\n\r\nby \r\n\r\n`func (m *Message) AddAttachment(name string, embedded bool, r io.Reader) error`\r\n\r\n\r\nAn other option could be to add a new method AddEmbededAttachament \r\n\r\nI propose to remove the contentType string as it is never used in the code (or maybe I'm blind, but guru didn't find any usage except from where we assign it a value). \r\n\r\n\r\nI also found a bug when we where sending more than one file at the time, with the following code. \r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc (sm SMTPSender) addAttachments(message Message, gm *gomail.Message) {\r\n\tfor _, at := range message.Attachments {\r\n\t\tsettings := gomail.SetCopyFunc(func(w io.Writer) error {\r\n\t\t\t_, err := io.Copy(w, atReader)\r\n\t\t\treturn err\r\n\t\t})\r\n\r\n\t\tgm.Attach(at.Name, settings)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI took me a while to debug it,  but I saw that inside the returning function it was always the last file that was called with the number of files available. And I remembered then that the returning function where only created at the end of the \"mother function\" so inside at was always the same value. With this it worked well.

When you make a change to anything in your config for live_reload (JavaScript, stylesheets, templates, and views by default) then the page will be reloaded in response to a message sent via the WebSocket.

in the Buffalo Slack channel an issue arose, and not for the first time. The user was saying that when they ran `buffalo g resource` they were getting `markbates/pop` imports instead of `gobuffalo/pop`. It turned out that while their app was running `v0.11.0` their binary was still at `v0.10.3`. This class of problem is common, using an older binary with a newer app, which can lead to all sorts of interesting issues.\r\n\r\nI am proposing the following solution/idea:\r\n\r\nWhenever `buffalo new` or `buffalo update` is run we copy the Buffalo binary into the project, potentially at `bin/buffalo` or `binstubs/buffalo`. This will allow users to run `./bin/buffalo g resource` and know that they're using the version of the Buffalo binary meant for their application. It would be recommended that this file be committed.\r\n\r\nThe upsides of this are always having the correct versioned binary for the app in question. We can even make the `buffalo` binary \"smart\" to look in that folder first, and if it finds a binary there, it will shell out commands to that binary instead. This means you wouldn't have to do `./bin/buffalo g resource`, but rather just `buffalo g resource`, and it will call the vendored binary in the app instead.\r\n\r\nThe downsides are if teams are using multiple OS's only the computer that runs `buffalo new` or `buffalo update` will create an insert a binary. So, for example, if this was done on a Mac, the Windows binary would be missing from `bin/`. The work around is to copy a windows binary into that folder. Having the binary in the app would also make the repo larger.\r\n\r\nSo while it looks like the downsides win, there is a lot of advantage to the upsides.\r\n\r\nI'm opening this up for discussions, I'd love to hear your feedback on it.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gobuffalo/buffalo/issues/985","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gobuffalo/buffalo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gobuffalo/buffalo/issues/985/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gobuffalo/buffalo/issues/985/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gobuffalo/buffalo/issues/985/events","html_url":"https://github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo/issues/985","id":307684977,"number":985,"title":"Buffalo
