// looks for a row in the users table\r\n\tReviews   Reviews   `has_many:\"publication_reviews\" fk_id:\"publication_id\"` // looks for rows matching publication_id in publication_reviews table\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there's a `has_many`, `belongs_to`, or `has_one` tag, pop shouldn't load anything, it's like having `db:\"-\"`. \r\n\r\nHowever, if I were to do something like:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ndb.Eager().First(&user)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should load `Books` and `Address`.\r\n\r\nIf I did:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ndb.Eager(\"Books\").First(&user)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would only load the `Books` association.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is for adding the ability to load, on demand, associations from within Plush templates.\r\n\r\nFor Example:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc SomeHandler(c buffalo.Context) error {\r\n\ttx, ok := c.Value(\"tx\").(*pop.Connection)\r\n\tif !ok {\r\n\t\treturn errors.WithStack(errors.New(\"no transaction found\"))\r\n\t}\r\n\tu := &models.User{}\r\n\tif err := tx.First(u); err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn errors.WithStack(err)\r\n\t}\r\n\tc.Set(\"user\", u)\r\n\treturn c.Render(200, r.HTML(\"foo.html\"))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n// foo.html\r\n<%= for (b) in user.Books { %>\r\n  <%= b.Title %>\r\n<% } %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, in the Plush template, a call to `user.Books` is made. \r\n\r\n1. Is `Books` already populated, if so, return.\r\n2. If `Books` isn't populated then check and see if it's an association, if it try and load it and populate it on the `user`\r\n\r\nWe have access to the `pop.Transaction` in the template because it's set onto the `buffalo.Context` in  a piece of middleware. \r\n\r\nThe difficult part here is to figure out how to hook into Plush when it is trying to figure out what to do with `user.Books`.
