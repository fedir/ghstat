now unsorted with 1998 and 1999 mixed together even though the column is sorted.  So our test fails because record #2 should not be 1999 it should be another 1998 `DataTable002Test.testLazyFilter:151 expected: <Language 18> but was: <Language 9>`  It appears to be sorted by the `Id` column now again.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4399574/98442117-c7a99c00-20d0-11eb-8a8e-2a2397e8ddad.png)\r\n\r\n@christophs78 @Rapster
