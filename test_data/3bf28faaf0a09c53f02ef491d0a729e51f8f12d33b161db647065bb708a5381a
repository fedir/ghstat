I think we can handle this with the view version concept introduced in 0.10. Here's an example view:\n\n``` html\n<div data-scope=\"post\" data-version=\"foo\">\n  foo\n</div>\n\n<div data-scope=\"post\" data-version=\"bar\">\n  bar\n</div>\n```\n\nRight now you can use view versions for a couple of things.\n1. Present a single list of posts using one version or the other per post.\n\n``` ruby\nview.scope(:post).version(posts) do |view, post|\n  # assumes post.type returns :foo or :bar\n  view.use(post.type)\nend\n```\n1. Present a single post using one particular version.\n\n``` ruby\nview.scope(:post).use(post.type)\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to render two lists of posts (one list for `foo` and one list for `bar`) you end up having to do something like this:\n\n``` ruby\nview.scope(:post)[0].apply(foo_posts)\nview.scope(:post)[1].apply(bar_posts)\n```\n\nI have a lot of issues with this, not the least of which is that it's extremely brittle.\n\nWith a relatively small addition to `Pakyow::Presenter::ViewVersion` we could support this:\n\n``` ruby\nview.scope(:post, version: :foo).apply(foo_posts)\nview.scope(:post, version: :bar).apply(bar_posts)\n```\n\nThoughts?

If you print out the result of `view.scope(:tile).html` on subsequent loads _before_ you ever attempt to bind the data, you'll notice that the view is still populated with the data from the previous request, which is what causes it to keep growing (in this case).\n\nHowever, if you copy the markup from `_tile.slim` and paste it directly into `index.slim` instead of loading it via `@include`, the data will be displayed correctly every time you refresh the page. So it seems like there's a flow that allows view transformations to be applied to partials without dupping them first.\n\nAnother oddity though is that if you only include the partial once instead of twice (and remove the view logic responsible for populating the second instance), the data is displayed correctly on every reload. So it seems like the sad path probably goes through `ViewCollection` at some point.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
