There is nothing in the file to indicate that the license applies only to the lucky framework, not to the user's own work. A note to this effect: \"This license applies only to the Lucky web framework - not the user's project.\" should be placed at the top of the license file, and it might be best to rename it to \"LUCKY_FRAMEWORK_LICENSE\" so that the user can have their own LICENSE file.\r\n\r\nWriting a default license for the user - if this is what you intended - is a legal minefield. The license file provides many parties (employees, consultants, anyone with access to the source) with permission to  redistribute, use, etc. software that the user often intends to keep proprietary or to place under another license. This is because the user is not a legal expert, and usually will not read the LICENSE file or understand its implications, and has not actually consented to apply that license to their own work. Sorting that out might require going to court with the parties who attempted to use the license. Both sides - the user who got a license unintentionally, and the people who used the license - might then sue Thoughtbot and the Lucky developers to recover their damages. The \"no warranty\" portion of the MIT license is probably not going to protect you in this case.\r\n\r\nThere is also the issue that stamping a default LICENSE file into the project directory for the user might be considered legal advice. In most states, only someone admitted to practice law in that state can provide legal advice, and then only to their contracted customers. There are criminal penalties.\r\n\r\nI am an intellectual property and technology specialist who advises attorneys, not an attorney. This is my opinion and is offered as advice to your attorney. Please show this to him or her. Under the law of most states, your attorney who is contracted to you is the only party who can provide you with legal advice.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luckyframework/lucky/issues/420","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luckyframework/lucky","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luckyframework/lucky/issues/420/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luckyframework/lucky/issues/420/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luckyframework/lucky/issues/420/events","html_url":"https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky/issues/420","id":314055548,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTQwNTU1NDg=","number":420,"title":"Button tag generates link i.e. 'a'","user":{"login":"ianpurton","id":36966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/36966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianpurton","html_url":"https://github.com/ianpurton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianpurton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianpurton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianpurton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianpurton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianpurton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianpurton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianpurton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianpurton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianpurton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":513188329,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MTMxODgzMjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luckyframework/lucky/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"e99695","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-13T10:34:02Z","updated_at":"2018-04-19T18:51:53Z","closed_at":"2018-04-19T18:51:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Whilst trying to get bootstrap navigation working I needed to do the following\r\n\r\n    <button class=\"navbar-toggler\" type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#navbarSupportedContent\" aria-controls=\"navbarSupportedContent\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-label=\"Toggle navigation\">\r\n      <span class=\"navbar-toggler-icon\"></span>\r\n    </button>\r\n\r\nSo I use the following lucky tags...\r\n\r\n    button to: \"\", class: \"navbar-toggler\", \"aria-controls\": \"navbarSupportedContent\", \r\n        \"aria-expanded\": \"false\", \"aria-label\": \"Toggle navigation\",\r\n        \"data-target\": \"#navbarSupportedContent\", \"data-toggle\": \"collapse\", \r\n        type: \"button\" do \r\n        span class: \"navbar-toggler-icon\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\nHowever this generates...\r\n\r\n    <a href=\"\" class=\"navbar-toggler\" aria-controls=\"navbarSupportedContent\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-label=\"Toggle navigation\" data-target=\"#navbarSupportedContent\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" type=\"button\">\r\n      <span class=\"navbar-toggler-icon\"></span>\r\n    </a>\r\n\r\nSo I think that it should generate a button tag not an 'a' tag.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luckyframework/lucky/issues/410","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luckyframework/lucky","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luckyframework/lucky/issues/410/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luckyframework/lucky/issues/410/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luckyframework/lucky/issues/410/events","html_url":"https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky/issues/410","id":311372959,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTEzNzI5NTk=","number":410,"title":"Seperate `browser` and `api` action generators","user":{"login":"mikeeus","id":16954412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTU0NDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16954412?v=4","gravatar_id":"",
