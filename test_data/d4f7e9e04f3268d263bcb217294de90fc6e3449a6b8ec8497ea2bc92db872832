I deployed the json scripts like simple-docker, that dockerizes an ubuntu14 and nginx-bridge provided by mesosphere to test the cluster. First I was able to scale more instances of the dockerized apps then I had slaves in my cluster.\nBut then I started to experiment with HAproxy and HAproxy-marathon-bridge and now the maximum number of instances is the number of slave machines that are connected to the cluster.\nActualy I started with 3 slave nodes and created the fourth from scrash, this one never had HAproxy of HAproxy-Marathon-Bridge installed, But also on this one only one instance possible.\n\nWhen I scale to 5 instances, 4 deploy and run without a problem, the fifth instance is hanging in deployments in Marathon. I deleted HAproxy and HAproxy-Marathon-Bridge from all machines, slaves and masters, only Keepalived service is still running on the master nodes.\n\nI checked the logs in var/log/mesos and see that only 4 and not 5 offers are made to Marathon.\n\nI dont know where to change this setting, if it's a setting of a flag to pass to the master, slave or marathon.\n\nI'm running Marathon 0.8.1 and Mesos version 0.22.0.\n\nHope anyone can help me with this one.\n\nGijs\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mesosphere/marathon/issues/1739","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mesosphere/marathon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mesosphere/marathon/issues/1739/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mesosphere/marathon/issues/1739/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mesosphere/marathon/issues/1739/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/issues/1739","id":92612959,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MjYxMjk1OQ==","number":1739,"title":"Marathon cannot deploy docker container when portMapping is specified.","user":{"login":"F21","id":2263040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjMwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2263040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/F21","html_url":"https://github.com/F21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-07-02T11:14:57Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T17:57:44Z","closed_at":"2015-07-02T13:25:50Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I am trying to deploy an etcd container and export the corresponding ports on the node it is deployed to:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"id\": \"kubernetes-etcd\",\n  \"cpus\": 0.6,\n  \"mem\": 512,\n  \"instances\": 1,\n  \"constraints\": [[\"hostname\", \"CLUSTER\", \"mesos-master-01\"]],\n  \"maxLaunchDelaySeconds\": 36000,\n  \"container\": {\n    \"docker\": {\n      \"image\": \"quay.io/coreos/etcd:v2.0.13\",\n      \"network\": \"BRIDGE\",\n      \"portMappings\": [\n        { \"containerPort\": 4001, \"hostPort\": 4001, \"protocol\": \"tcp\" },\n        { \"containerPort\": 2380, \"hostPort\": 2380, \"protocol\": \"tcp\" },\n        { \"containerPort\": 2379, \"hostPort\": 2379, \"protocol\": \"tcp\" }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"args\": [\n            \"-advertise-client-urls http://192.168.33.10:2379,http://192.168.33.10:4001\", \"-listen-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379,http://0.0.0.0:4001\",\n            \"-initial-advertise-peer-urls http://192.168.33.10:2380\", \"-listen-peer-urls http://0.0.0.0:2380\", \"-initial-cluster-token etcd-cluster-1\",\n            \"-initial-cluster etcd0=http://192.168.33.10:2380\", \"-initial-cluster-state new\"\n          ]\n}\n```\n\nFor some reason, the task will stay in deploying mode and refuse to launch.
