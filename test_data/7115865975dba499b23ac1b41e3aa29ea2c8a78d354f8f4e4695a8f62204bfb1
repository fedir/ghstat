To reproduce : \r\n\r\n- Install the attached component I made to demonstrate the problem\r\n- Add 2 instance of that component on the same page\r\n- Display your page : see the event log that display the alias value of your component in the onRun method.\r\n- Now click on both link that is displayed by the component and look at the event log each time. You will see that when you click on the link of the **second** component, the alias of the first one is displayed instead.\r\n\r\n##### October build\r\n434\r\n[acme.zip](https://github.com/octobercms/october/files/1902243/acme.zip)\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3492","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3492/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3492/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3492/events","html_url":"https://github.com/octobercms/october/issues/3492","id":312568831,"number":3492,"title":"Please update Froala","user":{"login":"jajacobs","id":8701133,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8701133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs","html_url":"https://github.com/jajacobs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":67885480,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-09T15:05:29Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T16:18:29Z","closed_at":"2018-04-09T16:18:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Trying to extend the richeditor to automatically scramble email addresses in links href attribute.

When open_basedir protection is enabled, this causes is_dir to crash, because it tries to read from a non-allowed location.\r\n\r\n##### Possible Solutions\r\n\r\n1. Remove \"_realpath(base_path('resources/views'))_\" from the default _config/view.php_ file\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n2.

Modifying the column `attachment_id` to an unsigned integer makes everything run a lot faster. If I understand correctly, this fix is still being reviewed.\r\n\r\nIn my usecase, I've made a component with an overview of mannequins (roughly 1300 mannequins, with 10-30 images each). Each mannequin is represented by his/her name and the first connected image from their relation below:\r\n\r\n    public $attachMany = [\r\n        'images' => 'System\\Models\\File'\r\n    ];\r\n\r\nTo get an overview of the mannequins in my component, I query as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic function onRun()\r\n    {\r\n        $mannequins = Mannequin::where('status', 1)->orderBy('sex', 'ASC')->orderBy('web_name', 'asc')->get();\r\n        $this->mannequins = $this->page['mannequins'] = $mannequins;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nBut this loads the mannequins with **all their images** instead of just the first one. This might not be a problem, since in the twig of my component, I can easily only show the first item.\r\n```\r\n{% for mannequin in mannequins %}\r\n                <figure >\r\n                    <img src=\"{{ mannequin.images.first.path | app }}\" />\r\n                    <figcaption class=\"c-model__name\">{{ mannequin.web_name }}</figcaption>\r\n                </figure>\r\n        {% endfor %}\r\n```\r\nSince I'm looking to get the **best possible performance**, my question is: is there a way to constrain the file attachments to only get the first connected image per mannequin in my `onRun` function?\r\n\r\nThank you for looking into this.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3413","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3413/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3413/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3413/events","html_url":"https://github.com/octobercms/october/issues/3413","id":299835311,"number":3413,"title":"Unknown database type bit requested","user":{"login":"bfloren","id":2178782,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2178782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren","html_url":"https://github.com/bfloren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":143616624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/labels/third%20party","name":"third party","color":"cccccc","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-02-23T20:09:23Z","updated_at":"2018-02-24T01:35:00Z","closed_at":"2018-02-23T20:50:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##### Expected behavior\r\nCreate new table via Builder\r\n##### Actual behavior\r\n\r\ntable not created.\r\n\r\n\"Unknown database type bit requested, Doctrine\\DBAL\\Platforms\\MySQL57Platform may not support it.\" on line 423 of /Users/brett/Code/Project11/vendor/doctrine/dbal/lib/Doctrine/DBAL/Platforms/AbstractPlatform.php\r\n\r\n##### Reproduce steps\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-02-23 at 3 04 07 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2178782/36614614-44820d38-18ab-11e8-8bda-b377478bad1c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##### October build\r\n4.3.3 using mysql 5.7.21\r\n\r\n\r\nI am just looking for the **recommended method** to address this problem.
