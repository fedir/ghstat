I am a web developer by profession and an experienced Filipino translator - these are on top of being an experienced web developer with more than 6 years of experience and specialized in the following scripting languages and technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, JQUERY, PHP, WORDPRESS and CONCRETE5). This means I know which codes are to be translated, and which ones that are to remain as it is. I am a strong advocate of thought-by-thought instead of word-by-word style of doing the translations, and I am carefully strict in grammars and spellings and proper word conjugations of my languages, Filipino and Tagalog.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you soon and work with you in the translations.

Modifying the column `attachment_id` to an unsigned integer makes everything run a lot faster. If I understand correctly, this fix is still being reviewed.\r\n\r\nIn my usecase, I've made a component with an overview of mannequins (roughly 1300 mannequins, with 10-30 images each). Each mannequin is represented by his/her name and the first connected image from their relation below:\r\n\r\n    public $attachMany = [\r\n        'images' => 'System\\Models\\File'\r\n    ];\r\n\r\nTo get an overview of the mannequins in my component, I query as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic function onRun()\r\n    {\r\n        $mannequins = Mannequin::where('status', 1)->orderBy('sex', 'ASC')->orderBy('web_name', 'asc')->get();\r\n        $this->mannequins = $this->page['mannequins'] = $mannequins;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nBut this loads the mannequins with **all their images** instead of just the first one. This might not be a problem, since in the twig of my component, I can easily only show the first item.\r\n```\r\n{% for mannequin in mannequins %}\r\n                <figure >\r\n                    <img src=\"{{ mannequin.images.first.path | app }}\" />\r\n                    <figcaption class=\"c-model__name\">{{ mannequin.web_name }}</figcaption>\r\n                </figure>\r\n        {% endfor %}\r\n```\r\nSince I'm looking to get the **best possible performance**, my question is: is there a way to constrain the file attachments to only get the first connected image per mannequin in my `onRun` function?\r\n\r\nThank you for looking into this.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3413","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3413/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3413/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3413/events","html_url":"https://github.com/octobercms/october/issues/3413","id":299835311,"number":3413,"title":"Unknown database type bit requested","user":{"login":"bfloren","id":2178782,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2178782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren","html_url":"https://github.com/bfloren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfloren/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":143616624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/labels/third%20party","name":"third party","color":"cccccc","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-02-23T20:09:23Z","updated_at":"2018-02-24T01:35:00Z","closed_at":"2018-02-23T20:50:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##### Expected behavior\r\nCreate new table via Builder\r\n##### Actual behavior\r\n\r\ntable not created.\r\n\r\n\"Unknown database type bit requested, Doctrine\\DBAL\\Platforms\\MySQL57Platform may not support it.\" on line 423 of /Users/brett/Code/Project11/vendor/doctrine/dbal/lib/Doctrine/DBAL/Platforms/AbstractPlatform.php\r\n\r\n##### Reproduce steps\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-02-23 at 3 04 07 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2178782/36614614-44820d38-18ab-11e8-8bda-b377478bad1c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##### October build\r\n4.3.3 using mysql 5.7.21\r\n\r\n\r\nI am just looking for the **recommended method** to address this problem.
