I came across it while writing a plugin that creates a backend user using `BackendAuth::register()`. Basically my plugin has a Foo model which takes in a username, password and other user fields to create an exclusive user for the Foo object but also sets it's created_by field to the currently logged in user to track who originally created the Foo record. Except that when I called `BackendAuth::getUser` after calling `BackendAuth::register` it returns the newly registered user instead of the currently logged in one.\r\n\r\n##### Expected behavior\r\n`BackendAuth::register()` should return the newly created user object without setting the current user as the newly registered user object.\r\n\r\n##### Actual behavior\r\n`BackendAuth::register()` returns the newly created user object but also sets it's user property to the newly registered user which causes subsequent calls to BackendAuth::getUser to return this newly registered user object rather than the currently logged in user.\r\n\r\n##### Reproduce steps\r\n(These were specific to my user case by the bug is more general, I've written the steps anyway...)\r\n1.

Expected behavior\r\nWhen you embed the same component twice on a page (with different alias for sure) and that component call an ajax method defined in the component, the value of $this always refer to the first added component.\r\n\r\n##### Actual behavior\r\nI added the same component twice on my page \"ajaxComponent1\" and \"ajaxComponent2\".\r\n\r\nLet's assume you have this method in your component :\r\n\r\n    <?php\r\n    public function onRun() {\r\n        trace_log('onRun', $this->alias);\r\n    }\r\n    public function onAjaxTest() {\r\n        trace_log('onAjaxTest',

see in the event log \"ajaxComponent1\" and \"ajaxComponent2\" and everything seems to work perfectly.\r\n\r\nBut if I click on the \"onAjaxTest\" link of my **second** component (ajaxComponent2), then I go to the eventlog, I can see that the alias is \"ajaxComponent1\".\r\n\r\n##### Reproduce steps \r\n\r\nI quickly made a plugin that demonstrate the problem. To reproduce : \r\n\r\n- Install the attached component I made to demonstrate the problem\r\n- Add 2 instance of that component on the same page\r\n- Display your page : see the event log that display the alias value of your component in the onRun method.\r\n- Now click on both link that is displayed by the component and look at the event log each time.

When open_basedir protection is enabled, this causes is_dir to crash, because it tries to read from a non-allowed location.\r\n\r\n##### Possible Solutions\r\n\r\n1. Remove \"_realpath(base_path('resources/views'))_\" from the default _config/view.php_ file\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n2. Replace realpath() with a better function that doesn't return false for non-existing folders\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n3.
