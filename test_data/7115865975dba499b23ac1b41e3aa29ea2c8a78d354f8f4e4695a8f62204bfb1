is regarding [this line](https://github.com/octobercms/library/blob/master/src/Auth/Manager.php#L93) which also sets the user while returning the newly registered user object. I came across it while writing a plugin that creates a backend user using `BackendAuth::register()`. Basically my plugin has a Foo model which takes in a username, password and other user fields to create an exclusive user for the Foo object but also sets it's created_by field to the currently logged in user to track who originally created the Foo record. Except that when I called `BackendAuth::getUser` after calling `BackendAuth::register` it returns the newly registered user instead of the currently logged in one.\r\n\r\n##### Expected behavior\r\n`BackendAuth::register()` should return the newly created user object without setting the current user as the newly registered user object.\r\n\r\n##### Actual behavior\r\n`BackendAuth::register()` returns the newly created user object but also sets it's user property to the newly registered user which causes subsequent calls to BackendAuth::getUser to return this newly registered user object rather than the currently logged in user.\r\n\r\n##### Reproduce steps\r\n(These were specific to my user case by the bug is more general, I've written the steps anyway...)\r\n1.

Now set the Foo record ($model) variable's created_by field to BackendAuth::getUser().

Expected behavior\r\nWhen you embed the same component twice on a page (with different alias for sure) and that component call an ajax method defined in the component, the value of $this always refer to the first added component.\r\n\r\n##### Actual behavior\r\nI added the same component twice on my page \"ajaxComponent1\" and \"ajaxComponent2\".\r\n\r\nLet's assume you have this method in your component :\r\n\r\n    <?php\r\n    public function onRun() {\r\n        trace_log('onRun', $this->alias);\r\n    }\r\n    public function onAjaxTest() {\r\n        trace_log('onAjaxTest', $this->alias);\r\n    }\r\n    ?>\r\n\r\nHere is the partial of my component : \r\n\r\n    <a data-request=\"onAjaxTest\" href=\"return;\">trigger onAjaxTest()</a>\r\n\r\nWhen I load the page, I can see in the event log \"ajaxComponent1\" and \"ajaxComponent2\" and everything seems to work perfectly.\r\n\r\nBut if I click on the \"onAjaxTest\" link of my **second** component (ajaxComponent2), then I go to the eventlog, I can see that the alias is \"ajaxComponent1\".\r\n\r\n##### Reproduce steps \r\n\r\nI quickly made a plugin that demonstrate the problem. To reproduce : \r\n\r\n- Install the attached component I made to demonstrate the problem\r\n- Add 2 instance of that component on the same page\r\n- Display your page : see the event log that display the alias value of your component in the onRun method.\r\n- Now click on both link that is displayed by the component and look at the event log each time. You will see that when you click on the link of the **second** component, the alias of the first one is displayed instead.\r\n\r\n##### October build\r\n434\r\n[acme.zip](https://github.com/octobercms/october/files/1902243/acme.zip)\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3492","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3492/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3492/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/issues/3492/events","html_url":"https://github.com/octobercms/october/issues/3492","id":312568831,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTI1Njg4MzE=","number":3492,"title":"Please update Froala","user":{"login":"jajacobs","id":8701133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDExMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8701133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs","html_url":"https://github.com/jajacobs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jajacobs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":67885480,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2Nzg4NTQ4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octobercms/october/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-09T15:05:29Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T16:18:29Z","closed_at":"2018-04-09T16:18:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Trying to extend the richeditor to automatically scramble email addresses in links href attribute.
