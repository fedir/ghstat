Current behaviour ###\r\n\r\nWhen we run \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rebar3 report compile\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/zotonic/zotonic we get over a minute build times, even when nothing needs compiling. I investigated this bug. We use an multi-app setup, with 75 applications in the apps directory. When rebar is run, it constructs a new `.app` file for every app. In each app the `.app.src` file contains `{vsn, git}` to get a version number from git. \r\n\r\nIn order to construct the version number rebar3 runs 4 git commands per app, resulting in 300 git commands to get the same version number.\r\n\r\nThis is done here: https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/blob/master/src/rebar_git_resource.erl#L285\r\n\r\nThis means that in order to run a single test case I have to wait for over a minute to complete.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour ###\r\n\r\nI would like the version number value to be cached when the apps are in the same git repository, so the refcount version number is constructed once, and re-used for all the apps coming from the same repository.\r\n\r\n### Proposal ###\r\n\r\nI can provide a PR for this.
