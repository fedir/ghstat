Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen you add a file to an Image or File field in a content item, the \"UPLOAD NEW FILE\" button does not work.  More specifically, the upload popup appears **behind** the `Select a file` popup, so it just can't be used.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Login as admin.\r\n2. Create a new content type with just a Title field and an Image field.\r\n3. Create a new content item of the new content type.\r\n4. Click the \"Browse...\" button next to the Image field.\r\n5. In the `Select a file` popup, select any folder.\r\n6. Press the \"UPLOAD NEW FILE\" button.\r\n    * **Result:** After a few browser footer messages saying it's waiting for the host, nothing appears to happen.\r\n7. Close the popup.\r\n    * **Result:** The upload popup is now displayed - because it was actually opened **behind** the `Select a file` popup, instead of in front of it.\r\n        * But, since the `Select a file` popup has already been closed, even if you select a file in the upload popup, you can not select it for the field.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe upload popup should appear in front of the `Select a file` popup.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nhttps://www.screencast.com/t/42f4NrMrUjc\r\n\r\n## Desktop (please complete the following information):\r\n\r\n* OS: Win 10 Pro\r\n*
