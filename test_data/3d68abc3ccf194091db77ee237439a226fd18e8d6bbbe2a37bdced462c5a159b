So i cannot pass a wrapped http client.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to wrap http client's transport, since it is a http.RoundTripper interface. But this interface imposes a limitation:  it says that round tripper should not modify request params. So i cannot create a round tripper middleware which, for example, adds some request headers.\r\nAlso, round tripper will be called for every request in chain of redirects. \r\n\r\nCurrently similar functionality can be achieved by using ClientBefore() and ClientAfter() options, but it is not very convenient. Sometimes you have to write two or more functions and pass intermediate values via context.\r\n\r\nConsider an example of logging external http requests including body params.\r\nYou have to extract params before doing the request and replace the body, because after request the body will be already read.\r\nSo you will have to use context to pass request params to the logging func:\r\n```go\r\nfunc CollectRequestParams(ctx context.Context, req *http.Request) context.Context {\r\n   params = extractRequestParams(req)\r\n   return context.WithValue(ctx, \"_request_params_\", params)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc LogRequest(ctx context.Context, resp *http.Response) context.Context {\r\n   params = ctx.Value(\"_request_params\")\r\n   // do logging\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAlso there is no way to log transport error.\r\n\r\nIf we had some interface for http clients (say, `HttpClient`), it would be much more convenient to write a single middleware for this:\r\n```go\r\nfunc LogRequestMiddleware(client HttpClient) HttpClient {\r\n   return func(req *http.Request) (http.Response, error) {\r\n        params = readBody(req)\r\n\r\n        resp, err := client.Do(req)\r\n\r\n        // do logging, respect er\r\n       return resp, err      \r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother example can be recording an external segment with Newrelic:\r\n```go\r\nfunc NewrelicMiddleware(client HttpClient) HttpClient {\r\n  return func(req *http.Request) (http.Response, error) {\r\n    segment := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, request)\r\n\r\n    resp, err := client.Do(request)\r\n\r\n    if err == nil {\r\n      segment.Response = resp\r\n    }\r\n    segment.End()\r\n    return resp, err\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI cannot use a round tripper middleware for this, because `newrelic.StartExternalSegment()` adds some headers to request therefore modifying  the request.\r\nAnd with before & after func i will have to pass started segment via context again.\r\n\r\nThe similar concept was adopted in twirp
