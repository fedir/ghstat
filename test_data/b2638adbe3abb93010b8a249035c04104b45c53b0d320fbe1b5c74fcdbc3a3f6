into a byte array due to logging the request in the line above.\r\n\r\nI would expect that in this case either\r\n\r\n- the MultipartFormBody would just read from the byte array if the stream is materialized\r\n- or alternatively, it at least outputs a more helpful error message\r\n\r\nThe current error message made me assume that something was wrong with the request that was being sent, sending me on a long goose chase to debug the actual request. An error message like \"Cannot read multipart data after stream has been materialized\" would be a little more helpful.\r\n\r\nReading from the materialized byte array is the best solution IMO, though. \r\n\r\nI understand that materializing the request comes with its own problems (e.g. if the requests are large), however, there are valid scenarios where one would want to do it anyways (e.g. during debugging) and then this error is not helpful, unfortunately.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/http4k/http4k/issues/116","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/http4k/http4k","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/http4k/http4k/issues/116/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/http4k/http4k/issues/116/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/http4k/http4k/issues/116/events","html_url":"https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/116","id":311931111,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTE5MzExMTE=","number":116,"title":"How to get more specific LensFailure messages?","user":{"login":"elifarley","id":519940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTk0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/519940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elifarley","html_url":"https://github.com/elifarley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elifarley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elifarley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elifarley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elifarley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elifarley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elifarley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elifarley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elifarley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elifarley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":567897075,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1Njc4OTcwNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/http4k/http4k/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"128A0C","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2018-04-06T10:48:58Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T03:22:44Z","closed_at":"2018-04-06T19:24:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Situation: I get a `HTTP/1.1 400 body 'body' must be object` response with an empty body after sending a JSON string to an HttpHandler.
