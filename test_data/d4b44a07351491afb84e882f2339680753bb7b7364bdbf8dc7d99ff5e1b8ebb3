And it is great.\n\nWe are doing something very similar. Our Vaadin UIs are also expressed by a \"file\" (this file may be an Xtext file or a XML file). **[1]**  We defined semantic metamodels and a project called ECView for it **[2]**. And put these inputs into EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) and get instances about each \"tag\".\n\nWe also added a very rich databinding capability for Vaadin. **[3]** Combining Vaadin databinding with Eclipse Databinding. We can bind almost every Vaadin-Property (based on Vaadin 7.1) to another Vaadin property, a Bean, a POJO, an EObject and something called a URI-Access.\n\n\nBinding the multiselection of a table to the input of a list is something like this:\n\n```\nbc.bind(VaadinObservables.observeMultiSelectionAsList(table), \n               VaadinObservable.observeContainerItemSetContents(list))\n```\n\n\nAnd every time the selection changes, the itemset of the list will be updated.\n\n\nAnd i am looking forward to contribute rich databinding capability for the com.vaadin.ui.declarative package.\n\nMy idea is, that databinding is only expressed by some interfaces. And implementations may vary. The most enhanced databinding capability offers Eclipse Databinding. And it was really easy to write Endpoints for Vaadin. And it is there and works like a charme. Also async (server introduced changes) works perfectly based on WebSockets.\n\n[1] https://github.com/lunifera/lunifera-samples-carstore/blob/development/org.lunifera.samples.carstore.aggregator/bundles/org.lunifera.samples.carstore.ui.application/ecviews/org.lunifera.samples.carstore.views.general.CurrencyDetails.ecview\n\nThis file expresses a fully functional application to maintain Currencies... Databinding is expressed by <bindings>\n\n[2] https://github.com/lunifera/lunifera-ecview/tree/development\nMetamodel: https://github.com/lunifera/lunifera-ecview/tree/development/org.lunifera.ecview.core.extension.model/model\n\n[3] https://github.com/lunifera/lunifera-runtime-web/blob/development/org.lunifera.runtime.web.vaadin.databinding/src/org/lunifera/runtime/web/vaadin/databinding/VaadinObservables.java\n\n----------------------------\n----------------------------\n\nMy idea: Maybe we can discuss databinding enhancement here. Tomorrow i will write a blog about Vaadin databinding. Planned to do it for month now. But tomorrow i will do and publish on \"Eclipse planet\".\n\nFor me it seems to be easy, to add proper databinding capabilities to the declarative parts of Vaadin. And there may be different vendors of databinding. One of them might be Lunifera by providing an Eclipse Databinding Based approach.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nBest Florian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___\n Imported from https://dev.vaadin.com/ issue #17347","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vaadin/framework/issues/2965","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vaadin/framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vaadin/framework/issues/2965/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vaadin/framework/issues/2965/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vaadin/framework/issues/2965/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vaadin/framework/issues/2965","id":194698576,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxOTQ2OTg1NzY=","number":2965,"title":"Improve Locale handling with system messages","user":{"login":"vaadin-bot","id":20280877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjgwODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20280877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaadin-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/vaadin-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaadin-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaadin-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaadin-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaadin-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaadin-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaadin-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaadin-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaadin-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaadin-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":849955233,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NDk5NTUyMzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vaadin/framework/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"Stale bot label"},{"id":16896446,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjg5NjQ0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vaadin/framework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2012-10-05T07:30:36Z","updated_at":"2020-09-07T12:23:22Z","closed_at":"2020-09-07T09:47:39Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Originally by @Legioth**\r\n\r\n___\r\nhttps://github.com/vaadin/framework/issues/966 adds a way of getting SystemMessages for a specific Locale.

by _Alberto Vázquez_**\n\n___\nHi,\n\nWe have a problem using Push functionality with vaadin 7.1.8 and Weblogic 10.3.4 (11g). Weblogic 10.3.x doesn´t support servlet 3.0 so we are forced to use http streaming instead of webSockets.\n\nUsing this configuration, unfortunately, weblogic is storing threads in stuck and the service is degraded over the time.\n\nAtmosphere proposes a solution to the problem, but the framework doesn't provide access to the servlet to perform the modification. Maybe there's a way to do it, but we didn't found it yet (you can close this ticket if so).\n\nWe understand that is imposible that vaadin Push functionality supports all application servers by default, but it should provide access, in this case to the atmosphere servlet, in order to address such problems.\n\nHow to produce the problem:\n\nDeploy Quicktickets app in a weblogic 10.3.x.\n\nRelated information:\n\n https://vaadin.com/forum#!/thread/4329837  https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/Enabling-Native-Support-for-WebLogic-11x-and-lower\n\nRegards.\n\n___\n Imported from https://dev.vaadin.com/ issue #12979","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
