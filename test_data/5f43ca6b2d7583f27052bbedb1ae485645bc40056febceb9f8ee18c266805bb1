Is there a civetweb example code to achieve this? If so in which file do I place the code? Many thanks!\r\n\r\nI went through the document and follow all the #555 discussion but I am still lost.\r\nFor example in Mongoose if I declare a --> **static struct mg_serve_http_ opts s_http_server_opts;** on top of my own C implementation file below the line **#include mongoose.h**. Then I can use the code below to add directive for my custom CGI executable:\r\n\r\n`// Set up HTTP server parameters\r\nmg_set_protocol_http_websocket(nc);\r\n**s_http_server_opts.document_root = \"web_root\";** // Set up web root directory\r\nif (mg_stat(s_http_server_opts.document_root, &st) != 0) {\r\nfprintf(stderr, \"%s\", \"Cannot find web_root directory, exiting\\n\");\r\nexit(1);\r\n}\r\n\r\n**s_http_server_opts.cgi_interpreter = \"fs/ph7_cgi\";**\t//set up cgi-interpreter directory and executable\r\n**s_http_server_opts.cgi_file_pattern = \".php$\";****\r\n**s_http_server_opts.index_files = \"index.php, index.html, index.htm, index.shtml, index.cgi\";**\r\nif (mg_stat(s_http_server_opts.cgi_interpreter, &cgi_st) != 0) {\r\nfprintf(stderr, \"%s\", \"Cannot find cgi_interpreter directory, exiting\\n\");\r\nexit(1);\r\n}\r\nThe bold lines in above code setup my cgi_interpreter executable and directory path; the file pattern and index files.\r\nI could also do: --> **s_http_server_opts.cgi_interpreter = \"./ph7_cgi\";** //set up cgi-interpreter directory.\r\n\r\nAs I porting to a ROM / Flash memory based device, everything run inside the hardware, no shell or console,and no commandline arguments to be run or passed to the device. The whole program is flashed into ESP8266Ex (a 4MB flash and 640k ram capacity micro-controller device).\r\n\r\nHow can I achieve the above equivalent with civetweb?

(lines 350 to 515)\r\nWe need to follow the content of \"buf\" and \"buf_fill\".\r\n \r\nAt the start buff isn't initialized, it will be filled by \"mg_read\" (ln 361)\r\n\"buf_fill\" will contain the size of the useful data in buff (ln 374)\r\n\r\nIf we're parsing the last parameter (or only one), we won't find & in \"buff \"thus \"end_of_key_value_pair_found\" is 0 (block ln 420 - 427)\r\n\r\nln461 buff is translated over itself (removing the buffer's useful part.) using memmove\r\nIt's ok, \"buf_fill\" is set to 0 (ln 464) => no useful data left in \"buf\"\r\n\r\nSince there's nothing to read any more, nothing happens until ln  509\r\n\"used\" should be 0 but isn't (next is computed before the memmove) and \"buf_fill\" is negative.\r\n\r\nFrom there we have bad stuff, \"buf_fill\" is cast to size_t (unsigned) => buf_fill > sizeof(buf) -1 (ln 358)\r\n\r\nThe next call to \"strchr\" is done with random data found in memory (ln381).\r\nIf the user is lucky, \"buf\" contains '0' and not '=' and we break line 384.\r\nif the user isn't I'm not sure but it's bad.\r\n\r\n### How to fix\r\nI still don't have a perfect understanding of this function (it's a bit long for a newcomer) but recomputing next after memmove may be enough ?\r\n```\r\n\t\t\t\tif (!end_of_key_value_pair_found) {\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tused = next -

The page loads two scripts--let's call them $.js and work.js from the local server.  They have to be local because of security requirements at the site.  I've derived some classes via CivetHandler to handle the routes, and one of those handles scripts.  The work.js file requires some \"macro replacement\" before going out to the caller, and $.js doesn't.  For convenience I'm just letting CivetWeb handle both.\r\n\r\nI know that anything derived from CivetHandler has to be thread-safe, and I reviewed my code again this morning to make sure I'm enforcing that, and I believe I am.  Nevertheless, sometimes I see the browser issuing overlapping requests for both $.js and work.js, and my log says they're both being handled--but $.js goes back to the caller as an empty stream, and work.js goes back as both scripts, separated by a redundant HTTP/1.1 header between the two scripts.\r\n\r\nThe browser is not impressed.  (Neither is QA.) \r\n\r\nSo, on the topic of reentrancy and thread-safety, should I be ensuring that--even though there are two instances of the script handler class, each presumably with a separate mg_connection, handling the requests--only one instance of a script handler is allowed to call mg_write at a time?  I might even have to elevate it to the \"parent\" class that derives from CivetHandler, as the issue might occur during overlapping calls from separate users.   The docs for mg_write() don't say that it should be tied to an exclusion mechanism, but mg_lock_connection() and mg_lock_context() exist--and the docs don't appear to suggest that they should always be bracketing calls to mg_write().
