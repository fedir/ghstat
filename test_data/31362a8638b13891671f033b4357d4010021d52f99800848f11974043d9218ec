It can be a field for embeding an iframe or just a Tweet added with the build-in embeding tool.\r\n\r\n### Specifics\r\n\r\nThe [`DisableXssProtectionListener`](https://github.com/bolt/bolt/blob/14b3ec1019fd3a6af91ff92e246ec9081e50e49f/src/EventListener/DisableXssProtectionListener.php) which adds that header is runed when the current route name is in the array defined in the [`disable_xss_protection_routes`](https://github.com/bolt/bolt/blob/180a3a4c21e37fe55a7c681657f53e1ada682c81/src/Provider/EventListenerServiceProvider.php#L30). The problem is when you click the Preview button Bolt is using `contentlink` route, not the `preview` one. I checked it by inserting `dump($route)` in the mentioned listener below 44 line.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n* Add to any content type a text field\r\n* Go to record editor\r\n* Put in that field `<iframe src=\"http://google.com\"></iframe>`\r\n* Click the preview button\r\n\r\n### Expected result\r\n\r\nPreview of that record should be displayed\r\n\r\n### Actual result\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6128754/38773669-cbf18c98-4052-11e8-900e-45cda3b65b5d.png)\r\n\r\nHow to fix it (temporarly)?\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nIf you have a bundled extension you can overwrite there the list of not protected routes\r\n```\r\n$app['disable_xss_protection_routes'] = [\r\n    'preview',\r\n    'fileedit',\r\n    'contentlink' // <= that helps\r\n];\r\n```\r\nHowever this is probably a workaround and just the route used for previews is wrong. That is also why I didn't create a PR.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bolt/bolt/issues/7432","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bolt/bolt","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bolt/bolt/issues/7432/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bolt/bolt/issues/7432/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bolt/bolt/issues/7432/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bolt/bolt/issues/7432","id":312133301,"number":7432,"title":"Officially \"unsupport\" IE","user":{"login":"SahAssar","id":5096632,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5096632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SahAssar","html_url":"https://github.com/SahAssar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SahAssar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SahAssar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SahAssar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SahAssar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SahAssar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SahAssar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SahAssar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SahAssar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SahAssar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bobdenotter","id":1833361,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1833361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter","html_url":"https://github.com/bobdenotter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bobdenotter","id":1833361,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1833361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter","html_url":"https://github.com/bobdenotter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobdenotter/following{/othe

If the callback function returns true, the current value from array is returned into the result array. Array keys are preserved.\r\n\r\n• so, if you don't pass a callback, all *falsy* values will be rejected\r\n```php\r\n$arr = [0, 1, 2, '0', '', null];\r\nprint_r(array_filter($arr));  // Will output: Array ( [1] => 1, [2] => 2 )\r\n```\r\n\r\n• then, if frontend sends `[0, 3]` in form, only `[1 => 3]` passes.\r\n\r\n• And after all it's dumped as `{\"1\":\"3\"}` to database.\r\n\r\nResume\r\n---\r\n1. **Array_filter** is a weak part. It rejects 0 option.\r\n2. Frontend sends incorrect keys. So it's a big bug, because if you rely on documentation ([defining-values-as-a-hash](https://docs.bolt.cm/3.4/fields/select#defining-values-as-a-hash)) people will assume that hash `{1: 'option1', 'anotheroption': 'option2'}` will work. But in fact - it won't.\r\n\r\n##### Another reproduction:\r\n- create a select key with values: \r\n```yml\r\nvalues:\r\n    1: opt1\r\n    2 : opt2\r\n    foo: opt3\r\n```\r\n- create a record, save it\r\n- change the order (1 ←→ 2).\r\n- 💥 you'll get another values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bolt/bolt/issues/7406","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bolt/bolt","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bolt/bolt/issues/7406/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bolt/bolt/issues/7406/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bolt/bolt/issues/7406/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bolt/bolt/issues/7406","id":308999499,"number":7406,"title":"Long menu item names: ellipsis probl...","user":{"login":"Boorj","id":2145313,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2145313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boorj","html_url":"https://github.com/Boorj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boorj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boorj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boorj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boorj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boorj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boorj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boorj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boorj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boorj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-03-27T14:41:13Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T15:07:20Z","closed_at":"2018-03-27T15:07:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Problem\r\n---\r\nIn some synthetic languages words are longer that in other.

I think something regarding session things happens while refreshing.\r\nThe \"Saved on\" date behaves strange - it shows the proper date on every save action (even the failed), but if the \"ago\" time is not correct, it means it failed to save.\r\nIt did not happen before, didnt see that issue on 3.4.8.\r\n\r\n### Specifics\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\n    * Mention the URL where this bug occurs, if applicable\r\n    * What version of Bolt are you using (down to the very last digit!)\r\n    * What method did you use to install Bolt\r\n    * What browser and version you are using\r\n    * Please mention if you've checked it in other browsers as well \r\n    * Please include *full error messages* and *screenshots* if possible\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to Bolt admin panel, choose a content type and get into editing the existing record.\r\n2. Notice its edit date e.g. Saved on: 10/9/2017 7:38:05 AM (5 months ago)\r\n3.

Switch to previous Bolt tab.\r\n8. Do some edits, do save. Check the date on right - for me it is Saved on: Mar 7, 09:23 **(5 months ago)**\r\n9.
