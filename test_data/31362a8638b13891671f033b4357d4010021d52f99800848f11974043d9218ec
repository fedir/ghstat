I've not pinpointed what the circumstances are that actually causes it to break, while the same setup works on another environment. \r\n\r\nWhat breaks is that after `composer install`, the file `extensions/vendor/autoload.json` has absolute paths, instead of relative ones. For example: \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"bobdenotter/seo\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"bobdenotter/seo\",\r\n        \"path\": \"/home/xxx/domains/xxx.io/extensions/vendor/bobdenotter/seo\",\r\n        \"webPath\": \"…\",\r\n        \"class\": \"…\",\r\n        \"constraint\": \"^3.0\",\r\n        \"valid\": true\r\n    },\r\n    \"bolt/email-spooler\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"bolt/email-spooler\",\r\n        \"path\": \"/home/xxx/domains/xxx.io/extensions/vendor/bolt/email-spooler\",\r\n        \"webPath\": \"…\",\r\n        \"class\": \"…\",\r\n        \"constraint\": \"^3.3\",\r\n        \"valid\": true\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor now, quick workarounds: \r\n\r\n1) Try running `composer install; cd extensions; composer install --no-dev` a second time, to regenerate the `autoload.json` file.\r\n2) add `\"symfony/finder\": \"^2.8, !=2.8.37\"` to your `composer.json`'s require section, prior to running `composer update`. \r\n\r\nThe change that seems to have introduced this issue is here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/26337\r\n\r\nI'll update this issue, when there's news.

Periodically, users are becoming caught in redirect loops resulting in their browser showing a 'Too Many Redirects' message. The issue manifests itself after the `bolt_authtoken_xxxx...` cookie stored in their browser expires.

We have 8 web servers running bolt, but all admin traffic is routed to a single node. We do this by filtering based on the /admin path. \r\nAll users affected have the correct permissions and can use the admin console without issue once successfully logged in.\r\nThe site is behind an AWS loadbalancer (ALB), SSL is terminated at the loadbalancer.\r\nClearing the browser cookies will fix the problem temporarily, for the life time of a `bolt_authtoken`.\r\nFlushing Redis DB will fix problem temporarily. \r\nI have set my `cookies_lifetime` to `60` seconds in our dev environment, this makes it easy to demonstrate the problem without manual intervention.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n- Login to Bolt CMS admin console with valid credentials\r\n- Observe browser cookies for `bolt_session` and `bolt_authtoken`\r\n- Observe expiry dates of cookies\r\n- Navigate around admin console, observe that `bolt_session` cookie expiry advances so as to always be 2 weeks after the last interaction. The `bolt_authtoken` expiry remains unchanged from it's original value\r\n- Wait for `bolt_authtoken` cookie to expire, or just remove it manually\r\n- Next interaction with admin console (e.g. press F5) results in redirect loop\r\n\r\n### Expected result\r\nUser is served with login page and asked to re-authenticate.\r\n\r\n### Actual result\r\nRedirect loop. HTTP 302 between /admin/login and /admin. Browser stops the loop automatically. \r\n\r\n### Additional Details / Things I've Tried\r\n - Setting `cookies_lifetime` to `0` appears to make this issue happen consistently and immediately. I had hoped that using Session cookie would have avoided the issue.\r\n- It appears the loop is between `Controller/Backend/BackendBase.php:116` and `Controller\\Backend\\Authentication.php:58 (ish)`.

Log in to the backend and create/edit the contenttype you just changed.\r\n3. Head to the dropdown menu and you will see that only \"Landscape 16:9\" is present.\r\n4. Select \"Landscape 16:9\" and save it.\r\n5. Reload the page.\r\n6. Open the dropdown menu again and you see both entries are now present.\r\n7. Remove the selected entry and save it again.\r\n8. After reloading the page the dropdown contains only \"Landscape 16:9\" again\r\n\r\n### Expected result\r\n\r\nAll values can be selected in the selectfield regardless of its datatypes\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nWhat I found so far:\r\nThe problem is of course the numeric key. Since the key isn't a string, the key will be used as a numeric array key, which will not work of course.\r\nGo to `view/twig/editcontent/fields/_select.twig` to `line 35` and `line 38` and you can see the key will be used directly as the array key:\r\n`{% if values[id]|default() %}`\r\n\r\nBy forcing the id as a string like this `values[id~\"\"]` the selectfield works as expected.\r\nI know the hack is not the way to go, but it shows it works with a string","score":1.0}]}
