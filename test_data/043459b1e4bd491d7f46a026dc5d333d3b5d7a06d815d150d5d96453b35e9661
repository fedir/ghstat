The first one is support of only one `Handler` for application. I came from Ruby world and I saw a lot of projects that use both Rails and Sinatra/Grape. Rails serves regular HTTP-requests for HTML pages and Grape/Sinatra provides an API.\n\nSo I think that we need to extend the current implementation of `Chain`. Maybe you would want to look at [this](https://github.com/rustless/rustless/blob/master/src/middleware.rs) implementation. There is a special error (`NotMatchError`) to say that the handler didn't match and we can go to the next.\n\nMaybe we can just add an another instance that will iterate through `Handlers` and implement `Handler` itself. What do you think about it?\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
