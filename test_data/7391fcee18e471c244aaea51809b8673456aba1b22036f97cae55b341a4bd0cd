The entity manager gets injected through autowiring.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// src/Command/SomeCommand.php\r\nclass SomeCommand\r\n{\r\n    public function __construct(PrivateService $privateService, EntityManagerInterface $entityManager)\r\n    {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# config/services.yaml\r\nApp\\Command\\SomeCommand:\r\n    arguments:\r\n        - '@App\\Service\\PrivateService'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to write tests for this Command, and mock both the private service and the entity manager. Following the comments in `config/services_test.yaml` I come to the following config:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# config/services_test.yaml\r\nservices:\r\n    _defaults:\r\n        public: true\r\n\r\n    # If you need to access services in a test, create an alias\r\n    # and then fetch that alias from the container. As a convention,\r\n    # aliases are prefixed with test. For example:\r\n    #\r\n    # test.App\\Service\\MyService: '@App\\Service\\MyService'\r\n    test.App\\Service\\PrivateService: '@App\\Service\\PrivateService'\r\n    test.doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager: '@doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my test, I create mocks for the `test.` services and then use the `CommandTester`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        static::$kernel = static::createKernel();\r\n        static::$kernel->boot();\r\n\r\n        $application = new Application(static::$kernel);\r\n\r\n        $command = $application->find('app:some-command');\r\n        $this->subject = new CommandTester($command);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut apparently only the private service mock gets injected. The entity manager is still the 'real' entity manager. Looking in the cache files generated by the DI component, I see:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// var/cache/test/ContainerF18H4dm/getSomeCommandService.php\r\n$this->privates['App\\Command\\SomeCommand'] = $instance = new \\App\\Command\\SomeCommand(($this->services['test.App\\Service\\PrivateService'] ?? $this->load(__DIR__.'/getTest_App_Service_PrivateService.php')), ($this->services['doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager'] ?? $this->load(__DIR__.'/getDoctrine_Orm_DefaultEntityManagerService.php')));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for the private service, it uses the `test.` one if it exists. But for the entity manager server, it always just uses `doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager`.\r\n\r\nUnsure whether this is expected behaviour, but I would expect to have my `test.doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager` service injected there if I have defined it.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/26618","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/26618/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/26618/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/26618/events","html_url":"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/26618","id":307328927,"number":26618,"title":"[Workflow] Add a method to the Registry which returns all workflows associated to a certain object","user":{"login":"alexpozzi","id":8307861,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8307861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexpozzi","html_url":"https://github.com/alexpozzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexpozzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexpozzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexpozzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexpozzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexpozzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexpozzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexpozzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexpozzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexpozzi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":100378,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02e10c","default":false},{"id":397995968,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/labels/Workflow","name":"Workflow","color":"dddddd","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-03-21T16:47:19Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T11:42:22Z","closed_at":"2018-04-02T11:42:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | -----\r\n| Bug report?
