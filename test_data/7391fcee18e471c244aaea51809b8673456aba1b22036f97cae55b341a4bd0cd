The entity manager gets injected through autowiring.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// src/Command/SomeCommand.php\r\nclass SomeCommand\r\n{\r\n    public function __construct(PrivateService $privateService, EntityManagerInterface $entityManager)\r\n    {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# config/services.yaml\r\nApp\\Command\\SomeCommand:\r\n    arguments:\r\n        - '@App\\Service\\PrivateService'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to write tests for this Command, and mock both the private service and the entity manager. Following the comments in `config/services_test.yaml` I come to the following config:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# config/services_test.yaml\r\nservices:\r\n    _defaults:\r\n        public: true\r\n\r\n    # If you need to access services in a test, create an alias\r\n    # and then fetch that alias from the container. As a convention,\r\n    # aliases are prefixed with test. For example:\r\n    #\r\n    # test.App\\Service\\MyService: '@App\\Service\\MyService'\r\n    test.App\\Service\\PrivateService: '@App\\Service\\PrivateService'\r\n    test.doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager: '@doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my test, I create mocks for the `test.` services and then use the `CommandTester`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        static::$kernel = static::createKernel();\r\n        static::$kernel->boot();\r\n\r\n        $application = new Application(static::$kernel);\r\n\r\n        $command = $application->find('app:some-command');\r\n        $this->subject = new CommandTester($command);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut apparently only the private service mock gets injected. The entity manager is still the 'real' entity manager. Looking in the cache files generated by the DI component, I see:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// var/cache/test/ContainerF18H4dm/getSomeCommandService.php\r\n$this->privates['App\\Command\\SomeCommand'] = $instance = new \\App\\Command\\SomeCommand(($this->services['test.App\\Service\\PrivateService'] ?? $this->load(__DIR__.'/getTest_App_Service_PrivateService.php')), ($this->services['doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager'] ?? $this->load(__DIR__.'/getDoctrine_Orm_DefaultEntityManagerService.php')));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for the private service, it uses the `test.` one if it exists. But for the entity manager server, it always just uses `doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager`.\r\n\r\nUnsure whether this is expected behaviour, but I would expect to have my `test.doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager` service injected there if I have defined it.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/26610","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/26610/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/26610/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/26610/events","html_url":"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/26610","id":306912451,"number":26610,"title":"[Feature] BDD Symfony Pack","user":{"login":"mnavarrocarter","id":17072441,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17072441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnavarrocarter","html_url":"https://github.com/mnavarrocarter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnavarrocarter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnavarrocarter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnavarrocarter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnavarrocarter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnavarrocarter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnavarrocarter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnavarrocarter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnavarrocarter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnavarrocarter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-03-20T15:20:00Z","updated_at":"2018-03-21T21:09:35Z","closed_at":"2018-03-21T19:37:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | -----\r\n| Bug report?      | no\r\n| Feature request? | yes\r\n| BC Break report? | no\r\n| RFC?             | no\r\n| Symfony version  | 4.1.0\r\n\r\nI would like to propose a new feature using the awesome stuff that we can build with flex!\r\n\r\nRight now, if you want to start with Behat in Symfony, it's not like the experience you get with doctrine or other \"packs\".
