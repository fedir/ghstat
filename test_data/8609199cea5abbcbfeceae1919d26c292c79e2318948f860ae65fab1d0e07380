MD5 to generate AES keys has some serious flaws. For example, there's a good chance that someone could figure out the AES key in a few seconds if they have a good rainbow table. Also, you can generate MD5 hashes like crazy on consumer-level GPUs (1-5 billion hashes per second easy on a SINGLE GPU that's less than $500) so the key becomes very easy to attack. PBKDF2 is slow (key stretching) and specifically designed for this use case since it's a key derivation function.\r\n\r\nRelated to
