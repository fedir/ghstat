not sure if the title is really relevant, perhaps I'll be able to change it later :\r\n\r\nI don't exactly know wether the way I installed `nova-framework` is ok or not, although I tried to follow the recommended options on the official site.\r\n\r\nShortly, I installed the project in my home directory, then made a symlink to its `webroot` directory from `/var/www/html/myApp` (`myApp` is the symlink. On Jessie, `/var/www/html` is the apache's default webroot).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that certain resoures can't be found ('resolved'), as the used path should be `../`, and it appears it is `./` instead. For example, an image cannot be displayed, as its containing folder is searched in the webroot directory, instead of the above one...\r\n\r\nAny advice ? To be honest, there's a thing that confuses me on the official site, it's saying :\r\n\r\n> This framework was designed and is strongly recommended to be\r\n> installed above the document root directory, with it pointing to the\r\n> webroot folder.\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, installing in a sub-directory, on a production server,\r\n> will introduce severe security issues.
