termination happens in reverse proxy or load balancer, so incoming request to express server is http. I understand this issue can be avoided by setting `x-forwarded-proto` header, so its not a big problem now.\r\n\r\n- Regarding cookie path, our reverse proxy (nginx) rewrites path to backend server, so the original request path from browser and and the path in incoming request to express server are different. Can I ask if there is any way to solve this? \r\nAlso incase we need to update path in future, does that mean all users need to be logged out

it.\r\n\r\nThese libraries use an old version of `iconv-lite` (0.4.24) which load streams or not depending on the snippet contained in this issue: https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/issues/202\r\n\r\nYou can see it loads streams if `process.versions.node` is defined, and it is usually undefined when bundling with browserify or webpack.\r\n\r\nExcept if we use BrowserFS and its shim for `process`, then `process.versions.node` become defined and it tries to load streams (and fail).\r\n\r\nThe workaround I found is to add the following line in the first lines of your app:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprocess.versions.node = undefined // to fix the iconv-lite error with streams\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't tested it extensively so I don't know
