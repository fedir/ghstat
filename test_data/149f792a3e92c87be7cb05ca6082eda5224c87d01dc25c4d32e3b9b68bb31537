I believe body_qs can be called only once on each request because the data is streamed using transport:receive.\n\nIn simple test using command line curl, giallo:post_param can be called many times on the samerequest, but once I generated some load using JMeter 100 concurrent threads to POST data, then cowboy starts throwing timeout nondeterministically.\n\nThe way Axiom deals with it is
