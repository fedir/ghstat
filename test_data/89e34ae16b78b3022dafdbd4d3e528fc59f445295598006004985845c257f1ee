This was links that load HTML from backend with pjax-jquery and are mounted to page on runtime (legacy way of doing SPA).\r\n\r\nI spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's wrong. After few hours of investigation I was able to pin point issue to single-spa and it was really strange because just importing package were breaking the links. So I started to look for a code that executes in global context, and found `navigation-events.js`. I was not expecting single-spa to do something before I call `start` - can you please explain why do you run this in global context and not when start is called?\r\n\r\nAnyway after some time of debugging I managed to pinpoint the exact place that caused problems to us:\r\n\r\n` window.dispatchEvent(\r\n       createPopStateEvent(window.history.state, methodName)\r\n   );\r\n`\r\n\r\nthat was in 5.8.0: \r\n\r\n`urlReroute(createPopStateEvent(window.history.state, methodName));`\r\n\r\nthe last change from a day ago, somehow this change breaks jquery-pjax plugin: https://github.com/yiisoft/jquery-pjax\r\n\r\nSince our app still in progress of migrating from old ways of doing SPA to new ones we can't abandon all jquery code and pjax links so we had to revert to 5.8.0 where all works as expected.\r\n\r\nSo we are now bound to 5.8.0. I wonder maybe there is another way of fixing this or avoiding that change that was introduced in 5.8.1?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nTry to use single-spa with https://github.com/yiisoft/jquery-pjax and it will cause pjax links to stop working.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nsingle-spa shouldn't break pjax links\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Path-Check/gaen-mobile/issues/579","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Path-Check/gaen-mobile","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Path-Check/gaen-mobile/issues/579/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Path-Check/gaen-mobile/issues/579/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Path-Check/gaen-mobile/issues/579/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Path-Check/gaen-mobile/issues/579","id":725943860,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MjU5NDM4NjA=","number":579,"title":"CVE-2020-11022 (Medium) detected in Alamofire-4.9.1","user":{"login":"whitesource-bolt-for-github[bot]","id":42819689,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDI4MTk2ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/in/16809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitesource-bolt-for-github%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/whitesource-bolt-for-github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitesource-bolt-for-github%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitesource-bolt-for-github%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitesource-bolt-for-github%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitesource-bolt-for-github%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitesource-bolt-for-github%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitesource-bolt-for-github%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitesource-bolt-for-github%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitesource-bolt-for-github%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitesource-bolt-for-github%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2276260038,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjc2MjYwMDM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Path-Check/gaen-mobile/labels/security%20vulnerability","name":"security vulnerability","color":"d1260f","default":false,"description":"Security vulnerability detected by WhiteSource"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-10-20T21:06:04Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T19:32:23Z","closed_at":"2020-11-05T19:32:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## CVE-2020-11022 - Medium Severity Vulnerability\n<details><summary><img src='https://whitesource-resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability_details.png' width=19 height=20> Vulnerable Library - <b>Alamofire-4.9.1</b></p></summary>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Library home page: <a href=\"https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/archive/4.9.1.zip\">https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/archive/4.9.1.zip</a></p>\n<p>Path to dependency file: gaen-mobile/ios/Podfile.lock</p>\n<p>Path to vulnerable library: gaen-mobile/ios/Podfile.lock</p>\n<p>\n\nDependency Hierarchy:\n  - :x: **Alamofire-4.9.1** (Vulnerable Library)\n<p>Found in HEAD commit: <a href=\"https://github.com/Path-Check/gaen-mobile/commit/5797233d8cdf8daf703b671306e48df2d1fd4cbd\">5797233d8cdf8daf703b671306e48df2d1fd4cbd</a></p>\n<p>Found in base branch: <b>develop</b></p>\n</p>\n</details>\n<p></p>\n<details><summary><img src='https://whitesource-resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/medium_vul.png' width=19 height=20> Vulnerability Details</summary>\n<p>  \n  \nIn jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.

I am not a developer or a professional bughunter, so please don't take this report as prescriptive action - it appears that the `jQuery.htmlPrefilter` method could be used to execute code in vulnerable versions if it accepts HTML inputs from unsanitized / untrusted sources.  \r\n\r\nSee project advisory for additional information: [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-jpcq-cgw6-v4j6](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-jpcq-cgw6-v4j6)\r\n\r\nThis is a low-priority report, since no exploits for this vulnerability are known in the wild at this time and I have not verified that vulnerable code is present in Tautulli. \r\n\r\nI ran across this running a basic Nessus scan against my own home network and verified the module is in fact 2.1.4 as of the latest version of Tautulli. Again, this is not a big deal, but I wanted to report it all the same. I have no idea if upgrading JQuery would introduce breaking changes. \r\n\r\nJQuery's upgrade guide: [https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/](https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/)\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\nN/A - see vulnerability disclosure here: [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11022](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11022)\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nVulnerability patched in version 3.5.0 and above\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nProvide screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Relevant Settings**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Tautulli and System Info (see Tautulli settings page)**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Link to logs (required)**\r\nSame supporting documentation as above:\r\n* [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11022](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11022)\r\n* [https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/](https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/)\r\n* [https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/](https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5)\r\n* [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-jpcq-cgw6-v4j6](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-jpcq-cgw6-v4j6)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nClose your issue when it's solved!

In the different test cases, it's visible, that contains() and find() method catches the same syntax error. My expectation is to catch the same syntax error with get() method too. get() behaves in this case like it understands what I tried to write down and it passes and fails, just like that syntax error would be not there at all. The problem here, that the same selector won't work in a different context, so this syntax error will fail eventually, but it would be better if it can fail with get() too, so we can find these typos faster.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\ncypress version: 5.3.0\r\nbrowser: chromium 78.0.3904.108\r\nOS: openSUSE Leap 15.0\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
