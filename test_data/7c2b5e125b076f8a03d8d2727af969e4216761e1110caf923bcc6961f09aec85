Description\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to #1591 because the fix #1664 didn't solve all issues related to nested dynamic Content Cache sections apparently.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can't reliably reproduce the issue, but more people reported similar issues in Slack:\r\nIn a production setup I have a nested dynamic cache section like this:\r\n\r\n- `cached`\r\n  - `dynamic`\r\n    - `cached`\r\n\r\nWith a dynamic `entryDiscriminator` that is dependent on some request arguments.\r\n\r\nIt all works as expected, but sometimes the dynamic content is rendered as\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u0002CONTENT_CACHE1e1ca04e3725be78b07b1d7cfe079ebd_74be16979710d4c4e7c6647856088456\u0003CONTENT_CACHE\r\n```\r\nAnd then for all following requests until cache is flushed.\r\n\r\n#### Assumptions \r\n\r\n1. The `CACHE_PLACEHOLDER_REGEX` in https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/blob/master/Neos.Fusion/Classes/Core/Cache/ContentCache.php#L53 won't match the marker above because it contains an underscore. Shouldn't it be `[a-f0-9\\_]+)` instead?\r\n2. In this case we use a Redis Cache Backend – Could it be, that the cache segment tokens special characters are \"lost in translation\" due to some encoding issue? \r\n\r\n### Affected Versions\r\n\r\nNeos: 3.3.8 (probably lower)","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/1947","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/1947/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/1947/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/1947/events","html_url":"https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/1947","id":302219956,"number":1947,"title":"Media module not working in Neos 3.3.7","user":{"login":"DrillSergeant","id":883552,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/883552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrillSergeant","html_url":"https://github.com/DrillSergeant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrillSergeant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrillSergeant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrillSergeant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrillSergeant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrillSergeant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrillSergeant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrillSergeant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrillSergeant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrillSergeant/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-03-05T09:09:38Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T15:37:56Z","closed_at":"2018-03-05T15:14:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just ran a `composer update` and Neos got updated to 3.3.7\r\nWhen opening the media-module I get an exception \r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: md5_file(resource://Neos.Neos/Public/JavaScript/ContentModule-built.js): failed to open stream: &quot;Neos\\Flow\\ResourceManagement\\Streams\\StreamWrapperAdapter::stream_open&quot; call failed in /srv/www/jumpboxpeter/httpdocs/Data/Temporary/Development/Cache/Code/Flow_Object_Classes/Neos_Neos_Utility_BackendAssetsUtility.php line 57\r\n```\r\nThe file resource://Neos.Neos/Public/JavaScript/ContentModule-built.js does not exist.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

The apply button remains unchanged and you can't persist the value.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nProperties should either work with every name including special chars or Neos should throw an error or notice informing that the property name is not stable.\r\n\r\nAs the new React UI seems unaffected, it might be just to fix the old UI.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe property is displayed but it doesn't work and you keep digging for errors.\r\n\r\n### Affected Versions\r\n\r\nNeos: 3.2  classic UI\r\n\r\nThe new React UI is not affected.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/1714","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/1714/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/1714/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/1714/events","html_url":"https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/1714","id":261839540,"number":1714,"title":"SQLSTATE[HY000] [1698] Access denied for user ''@'localhost'","user":{"login":"igodorogea","id":4079076,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4079076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igodorogea","html_url":"https://github.com/igodorogea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igodorogea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igodorogea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igodorogea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igodorogea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igodorogea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igodorogea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igodorogea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igodorogea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igodorogea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-09-30T11:59:27Z","updated_at":"2017-09-30T21:21:29Z","closed_at":"2017-09-30T21:21:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I tried to install neos with composer as described [here](https://www.neos.io/download-and-extend.html)\r\nbut when I run `./flow server:run` I get this:\r\n```\r\nAn exception occured in driver: SQLSTATE[HY000] [1698] Access denied for user ''@'localhost'\r\n\r\nType: Doctrine\\DBAL\\Exception\\DriverException\r\nFile: Packages/Libraries/doctrine/dbal/lib/Doctrine/DBAL/Driver/AbstractMySQLDriv\r\ner.php\r\nLine: 115\r\n\r\nNested exception:\r\nSQLSTATE[HY000] [1698] Access denied for user ''@'localhost'\r\n\r\nType: Doctrine\\DBAL\\Driver\\PDOException\r\nCode: 1698\r\nFile: Packages/Libraries/doctrine/dbal/lib/Doctrine/DBAL/Driver/PDOConnection.php\r\nLine: 47\r\n\r\nNested exception:\r\nSQLSTATE[HY000] [1698] Access denied for user ''@'localhost'\r\n\r\nType: PDOException\r\nCode: 1698\r\nFile: Packages/Libraries/doctrine/dbal/lib/Doctrine/DBAL/Driver/PDOConnection.php\r\nLine: 43\r\n\r\nException Code\t1355480641\r\nException Type\tNeos\\Flow\\Core\\Booting\\Exception\\SubProcessException\r\nLog Reference\t20170930133648098329\r\nThrown in File\tPackages/Framework/Neos.Flow/Classes/Core/Booting/Scripts.php\r\nLine\t612\r\n```\r\nDoes that means that it requires a present mysql anonymous user?
