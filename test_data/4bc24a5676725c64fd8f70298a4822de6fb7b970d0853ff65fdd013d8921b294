The Prado Group,\r\n\r\nFirst, thank you for the fantastic framework. I have been using it for years and I am still impressed how it is designed and how it works.\r\n\r\nToday I am trying to update the PRADO framework in my web application from version 3.3.2 to version 4.0.1.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading I noticed the following Exception from:\r\n\r\n/usr/share/baculum/htdocs/protected/vendor/pradosoft/prado/framework/I18N/core/Gettext/TGettext.php (106):\r\n\r\n`Class file /usr/share/baculum/htdocs/protected/Web/Lang/en/messages.mo not found`\r\n\r\nI have prepared a patch in which I fixed this problem and also I tweaked the class file name to show PHP class filename in Exception instead of Gettext MO filename. I would like to propose you this patch.\r\n\r\n[fix-for-getting-gettext-format-instance.patch.txt](https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/files/1935271/fix-for-getting-gettext-format-instance.patch.txt)\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for the fix.\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\nMarcin Haba (gani)","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pradosoft/prado/issues/667","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pradosoft/prado","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pradosoft/prado/issues/667/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pradosoft/prado/issues/667/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pradosoft/prado/issues/667/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/667","id":310216894,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTAyMTY4OTQ=","number":667,"title":"In Prado version 4.0.1 index.html file is missing from the zip's  root directory ","user":{"login":"prbt2016","id":17871448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODcxNDQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17871448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prbt2016","html_url":"https://github.com/prbt2016","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prbt2016/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prbt2016/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prbt2016/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prbt2016/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prbt2016/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prbt2016/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prbt2016/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prbt2016/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prbt2016/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-03-31T06:24:47Z","updated_at":"2018-04-05T08:22:14Z","closed_at":"2018-04-05T08:22:14Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hi,\r\nI downloaded Prado latest version i.e 4.0.1 from here : \r\nhttps://github.com/pradosoft/prado/releases .

The string value of Cache property is not casted to boolean. So if you set Cache=\"false\" the if condition results true because it's a not empty string.\n2. The Autosave property was not considered. Messages should only be saved when this property is set to true.\n\nCode:\n\n``` php\npublic static function init($catalogue='messages')\n{\n  static $saveEventHandlerAttached=false;\n\n  //initialized the default class wide formatter\n  if(!isset(self::$formatters[$catalogue]))\n  {\n    $app = Prado::getApplication()->getGlobalization();\n    $config = $app->getTranslationConfiguration();\n    $source = MessageSource::factory($config['type'],\n                    $config['source'],\n                    $config['filename']);\n\n    $source->setCulture($app->getCulture());\n\n    if(TPropertyValue::ensureBoolean($config['cache']))//### FIX 1\n      $source->setCache(new MessageCache($config['cache']));\n\n    self::$formatters[$catalogue] = new MessageFormat($source, $app->getCharset());\n\n    //mark untranslated text\n    if($ps=$config['marker'])\n
