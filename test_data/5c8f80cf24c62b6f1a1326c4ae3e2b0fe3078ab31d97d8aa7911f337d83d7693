I'm trying to follow [this](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/schema-customization/#feeding-remote-images-into-gatsby-image) guide to feed images from a Strapi CMS to gatsby-image. When querying from gatsby Graphiql I receive a 400 error from Strapi. \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  strapi {\r\n    header {\r\n     logo {\r\n      imageFile {\r\n        childImageSharp{\r\n          fixed(width:400){\r\n            src\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnalyzing the request sent by gatsby, it looks like the query is empty. Now if I add some fields before imageFile everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  strapi {\r\n    header {\r\n     logo {\r\n   \t\tid\r\n      url\r\n      imageFile {\r\n        childImageSharp{\r\n          fixed(width:400){\r\n            src\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this just use this: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-gatsby-source-graphql\r\nand any CMS.\r\n\r\n### Expected result\r\n\r\nThe query should work fine.\r\n\r\n### Actual result\r\n\r\nGatsby is sending an empty query that the CMS fails to parse. \r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.15.7\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770HQ CPU @ 2.20GHz\r\n    Shell: 5.7.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 14.15.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.5 - ~/.yarn/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.14.8 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Languages:\r\n    Python: 2.7.16 - /usr/bin/python\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 86.0.4240.183\r\n    Firefox: 82.0.2\r\n    Safari: 14.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    gatsby: ^2.25.3 => 2.25.3 \r\n    gatsby-image: ^2.4.21 => 2.4.21 \r\n    gatsby-plugin-react-helmet: ^3.3.14 => 3.3.14 \r\n    gatsby-plugin-sharp: ^2.7.1 => 2.7.1 \r\n    gatsby-plugin-styled-components: ^3.3.14 => 3.3.14 \r\n    gatsby-source-filesystem: ^2.4.2 => 2.4.2 \r\n    gatsby-source-graphql: ^2.7.7 => 2.7.7 \r\n    gatsby-transformer-sharp: ^2.5.21 => 2.5.21 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    gatsby-cli: 2.12.100\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/8600","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/8600/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/8600/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/8600/events","html_url":"https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/8600","id":739016219,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzkwMTYyMTk=","number":8600,"title":"User registration returns Error 400 \"Bad Request\" when email confirmation is ON","user":{"login":"Elfoslav","id":1983575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODM1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1983575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elfoslav","html_url":"https://github.com/Elfoslav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elfoslav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elfoslav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elfoslav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elfoslav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elfoslav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elfoslav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elfoslav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elfoslav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elfoslav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":842587014,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NDI1ODcwMTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/labels/status:%20can't%20reproduce","name":"status: can't reproduce","color":"dda035","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2020-11-09T13:11:07Z","updated_at":"2020-11-10T14:50:45Z","closed_at":"2020-11-10T10:57:18Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!--\r\nHello 👋 Thank you for submitting an issue.\r\n\r\nBefore you start, please make sure your issue is understandable and reproducible.\r\nTo make your issue readable make sure you use valid Markdown syntax.\r\n\r\nhttps://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\r\n\r\nPlease ensure you have also read and understand the contributing guide.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Bug report\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nUser registration returns Error 400 \"Bad Request\" when email confirmation is ON.

It makes the app totally unusable.\r\nIt also happens with the queries that Strapi admin makes when fetching the data of the collection types.\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI have experienced a drastic slow-down of MongoDB's performance. When fetching all data from a collection type (`Article category` which has 8 records) it will take ~13 seconds which is absolutely crazy. This collection type has a relation with `Articles` (~1200 records) which is what seems to be causing the speed issue, which still is crazy considering the amount of documents.\r\n\r\nIf I add `\"autoPopulate\" : false ` to the model, the GraphQL query will take milliseconds, but the problem is that in Strapi Admin, all  related `Articles` will be empty.\r\n\r\nThis is a common issue I've had after having thousands (~7k) of records in my DB and has made the app unusable (one heavier query currently takes 20seconds)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\n1. Run the below query or go to collection type `Article categories` to see the 8 existing records\r\n2. See time necessary to get a response\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe query should take milliseconds \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nScreenshots of the time it takes the query to resolve 13 seconds and also Strapi Admin's request in the collection type `Article categories` \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1794\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-10-31 at 21 41 40\"

error because i used the property name 'Title' on several different components which didnt play well with graphql, so i went back into the collection types and renamed them from 'Title' to 'CompNameTitle' these are normal string properties that have also been set to Required in the advanced section.\r\n\r\nEverything seem to start working from then until i went into my Collection Type View to start adding content which caused a major problem when trying to save. this is the error i got.\r\n```\r\ninsert into \"components_page_comps_benefits\" (\"benefitTitle\") values ($1) returning * - null value in column \"title\" violates not-null constraint\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\n1. Create a new component with \"someName\" name property and set it to Required\r\n2. Save and exit\r\n3. Go back to the newly created component and rename the property you added to \"someOtherName\"\r\n4. save and exit\r\n5. go to your collection and enter some information into the fields then press save\r\n6. the error should now be displayed (not very long had to quickly screenshot it to try and read it)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect that after changing the name i should be able to go into the collection type view and just and my information and press save and it saves without any problems.\r\n\r\n### What I suspect\r\n\r\nafter a few minutes playing around I decided to go into the database and see what's happening as i suspected that the previously created property 'Title' was still lingering in the database table.\r\n\r\nmy suspicion was correct as the column 'Title' that was renamed was still there and it also still had the not-null settings on it which meant that when i was trying to save before the database was preventing me from creating an entry as i didnt have any value for that required property.\r\n\r\nwe should have these tables automatically renamed when we rename the property or removed as it cause problems that requires to drop the columns manually.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n### Code snippets\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add code samples to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\n- Node.js version: v12.18.4\r\n- NPM version: 6.14.6\r\n- Strapi version: 3.2.5\r\n- Database: postgreSQL\r\n- Operating system: windows 10.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/8444","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/8444/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/8444/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/issues/8444/events","html_url":"https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/8444","id":727483942,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3Mjc0ODM5NDI=","number":8444,"title":"Renaming Collection Type Doesn't Reach \"Users & Permissions\" Plugin","user":{"login":"ngreve","id":18660100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjYwMTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/18660100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngreve","html_url":"https://github.com/ngreve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngreve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngreve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngreve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngreve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngreve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngreve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngreve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngreve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngreve/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":878870559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4Nzg4NzA1NTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/strapi/strapi/labels/status:%20duplicate","name":"status: duplicate","color":"ececec","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2020-10-22T15:15:43Z","updated_at":"2020-10-26T17:45:12Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T21:47:41Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Bug report\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen renaming collection types, the name in `Roles->Edit Role->Permissions` does not get updated.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\n1.
