all,\r\n\r\nthere is a nice TODO on the list: A RESTful router. Since this would be very nice to have, I started to implement a RESTful router. The implementation is similar to a Rails Ressource. In general a Plan to do the following changes:\r\n * Create a Resource Base Class like (HTTPMethodView)\r\n * Decorators for custom mappings (Method, Url)\r\n * New sanic app method to add a resource\r\n\r\nI would like to know if there is any implementation already and if you have any comments. :-)","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
