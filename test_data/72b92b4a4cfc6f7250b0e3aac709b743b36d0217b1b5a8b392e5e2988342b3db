extending the `query()` from core oci8 driver and I've found bug on `$result->field_data()` (`$result` is an `oci8_result` returned from `parent::query()` method).\r\nThe `field_data()` is returning one less fields on subsequent queries after doing select query with `limit()`.\r\n\r\nHere's the scenario where it failed:\r\n```\r\n// query with limit\r\n$db->limit(5)->get('TABLE'); // field_data() returns full fields here\r\n\r\n// subsequent query\r\n$db->get('TABLE'); // field_data() returns one-less fields\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's how I extends the query() and found the bug:\r\n```\r\npublic function query($sql, $binds = FALSE, $return_object = NULL)\r\n{\r\n\t$result = parent::query($sql, $binds, $return_object);\r\n        // ............\r\n        $field_data = $result->field_data();\r\n       // dump field_data to check the fields, second query will return one-less fields\r\n       var_dump($field_data); \r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter I trace oci8 driver files, I found that `$this->limit_used` is not reset to `FALSE` after select query is reset. Why it matters? When `$this->limit_used` is `TRUE`,  number of fields that being returned by `field_data()` will be subtracted by 1.\r\n\r\nSo my fix / workaround is by adding/overriding `_reset_select()` method on `oci8_driver`\r\n```\r\nprotected function _reset_select ()\r\n{\r\n        parent::_reset_select();\r\n        $this->limit_used = false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this problem occurs only with `oci8` driver.\r\nI hope it's already fixed in future release. \r\nThanks.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5433","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5433/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5433/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5433/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5433","id":302525019,"number":5433,"title":"Redis session driver returning false in loop","user":{"login":"Kwozzie","id":3377927,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3377927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kwozzie","html_url":"https://github.com/Kwozzie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kwozzie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kwozzie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kwozzie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kwozzie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kwozzie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kwozzie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kwozzie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kwozzie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kwozzie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-03-06T01:09:08Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T05:31:49Z","closed_at":"2018-03-14T05:31:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Looking at system/libraries/Session/drivers/Session_redis_driver.php, it seems that it should be `continue`ing instead of `return FALSE`.\r\n\r\nIf redis->set is unable to set/write the value (with nx argument) then it is possible that another process is saving to that same lock key at the same time, therefore, it would be valid to continue (and try again) instead of returning false.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\tdo\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tif (($ttl = $this->_redis->ttl($lock_key)) > 0)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tsleep(1);\r\n\t\t\t\tcontinue;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t$result = ($ttl === -2)\r\n\t\t\t\t?
