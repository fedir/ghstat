am new to use iris. I am not sure what i said is right, but just feel the party's done method is strange.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\na:=app.Party(\"/a\")\r\na.Done(ADone)\r\n\r\nb:=app.Party(\"/b\")\r\nb.Get(\"/c\",BCHandler)\r\nb.Done(BDone)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen i call /b/c, i want to just call the BDone method finnaly, but it called both ADone and BDone method. After searching in the source code i found there are two methods strange:\r\n```\r\n// Party groups routes which may have the same prefix and share same handlers,\r\n// returns that new rich subrouter.\r\n//\r\n// You can even declare a subdomain with relativePath as \"mysub.\" or see `Subdomain`.\r\nfunc (api *APIBuilder) Party(relativePath string, handlers ...context.Handler) Party {\r\n\tparentPath := api.relativePath\r\n\tdot := string(SubdomainPrefix[0])\r\n\tif len(parentPath) > 0 && parentPath[0] == '/' && strings.HasSuffix(relativePath, dot) {\r\n\t\t// if ends with . , i.e admin., it's subdomain->\r\n\t\tparentPath = parentPath[1:] // remove first slash\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// this is checked later on but for easier debug is better to do it here:\r\n\tif api.relativePath[len(api.relativePath)-1] == '/' && relativePath[0] == '/' {\r\n\t\trelativePath = relativePath[1:] // remove first slash if parent ended with / and new one started with /.\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// if it's subdomain then it has priority, i.e:\r\n\t// api.relativePath == \"admin.\"\r\n\t// relativePath == \"panel.\"\r\n\t// then it should be panel.admin.\r\n\t// instead of admin.panel.\r\n\tif hasSubdomain(parentPath) && hasSubdomain(relativePath) {\r\n\t\trelativePath = relativePath + parentPath\r\n\t\tparentPath = \"\"\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tfullpath := parentPath + relativePath\r\n\t// append the parent's + child's handlers\r\n\tmiddleware := joinHandlers(api.middleware, handlers)\r\n\r\n\treturn &APIBuilder{\r\n\t\t// global/api builder\r\n\t\tmacros:              api.macros,\r\n\t\troutes:              api.routes,\r\n\t\terrorCodeHandlers:   api.errorCodeHandlers,\r\n\t\tbeginGlobalHandlers: api.beginGlobalHandlers,\r\n\t\tdoneGlobalHandlers:  api.doneGlobalHandlers,\r\n\t\treporter:            api.reporter,\r\n\t\t// per-party/children\r\n\t\tmiddleware:   middleware,\r\n\t\trelativePath: fullpath,\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n// Done appends to the very end, Handler(s) to the current Party's routes and child routes\r\n// The difference from .Use is that this/or these Handler(s) are being always running last.\r\nfunc (api *APIBuilder) Done(handlers ...context.Handler) {\r\n\tfor _, r := range api.routes.routes {\r\n\t\tr.done(handlers) // append the handlers to the existing routes\r\n\t}\r\n\t// set as done handlers for the next routes as well.\r\n\tapi.doneGlobalHandlers = append(api.doneGlobalHandlers, handlers...)\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe Party method set the global routes **api.routes** to the APIBuilder, and then return it, the Done method range the **api.routes.routes** to append the handlers to the existing routes, lead to the above result. \r\n\r\nWhy the Done method use the api.routes.routes? When use api.routes.routes, the actual execute result will rely on the order that the routes registed and it may lead to unexpected result when work together.  I think it should use api.apiRoutes instead of api.routes.routes.
