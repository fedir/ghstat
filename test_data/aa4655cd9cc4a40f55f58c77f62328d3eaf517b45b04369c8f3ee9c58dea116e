/pre>\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\nCurrently, specifying `useFactory` with injected parameters doesn't compile properly without also specifying the injectables in `deps`.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nI'd expect the AoT compiler to be able to understand the dependency injection without having to explicitly specify it under `deps` (just like it works with components, other providers, etc).\r\n\r\nThis might be made slightly more difficult because (last I heard) parameter decorators are currently not allowed for function declarations (but only on methods, etc). See https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/3661. But this would only make usage of `@Inject()` difficult, whereas normal dependency injection should still work.\r\n\r\n## Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-kukwtv?file=app%2Fapp.module.ts\r\n\r\n## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\nMore consistency with how dependency injection works elsewhere, and more convenience.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular version: head\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\n<!-- Anything else relevant?

is a Level 1 [TC39 proposal  to add an optional chaining (`?.`) operator to ECMAScript](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining).  \r\n\r\nThis operator is similar to the Angular template safe navigation operator.  The TC39 proposal document listed prior art of similar operators in other languages, but did not list the Angular template operator.  I [ created an issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining/issues/58) suggesting that the Angular template operator be listed as prior art, and a question was posed about the semantics of the Angular operator with respect to short circuiting.\r\n\r\nI think there would be value in ensuring that the semantics of the Angular template operator be harmonized with anything that is going to be added to ECMAScript through TC39.  I would like to suggest that the appropriate core Angular devs be made aware of this proposal and contribute as appropriate.  In particular if anyone could engage in the discussion at\r\nhttps://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining/issues/58, and answer the question about short-circuiting, that would be great!","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/23057","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/23057/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/23057/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/23057/events","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/23057","id":309668190,"number":23057,"title":"@Injectable providedIn should be able to create a new service instance per component","user":{"login":"benneq","id":1627305,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1627305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benneq","html_url":"https://github.com/benneq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benneq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benneq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benneq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benneq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benneq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benneq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benneq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benneq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benneq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/milestones/83","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/milestone/83","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/milestones/83/labels","id":3143880,"number":83,"title":"needsTriage","description":"Milestone for all issues that haven't been triaged yet","creator":{"login":"ocombe","id":265378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/265378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocombe","html_url":"https://github.com/ocombe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocombe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocombe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocombe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocombe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocombe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocombe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocombe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocombe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocombe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":433,"closed_issues":200,"state":"open","created_at":"2018-02-26T14:22:18Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T21:22:17Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-03-29T08:43:14Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T10:12:55Z","closed_at":"2018-03-29T10:12:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\nPLEASE HELP US PROCESS GITHUB ISSUES FASTER BY PROVIDING THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION.\r\n\r\nISSUES MISSING IMPORTANT INFORMATION MAY BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATION.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## I'm submitting a...\r\n<!-- Check one of the following options with \"x\" -->\r\n<pre><code>\r\n[ ] Regression (a behavior that used to work and stopped working in a new release)\r\n[ ] Bug report  <!-- Please search GitHub for a similar issue or PR before submitting -->\r\n[x] Feature request\r\n[ ] Documentation issue or request\r\n[ ] Support request => Please do not submit support request here, instead see https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#question\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\n<!-- Describe how the issue manifests. -->\r\nCurrently it's not possible to use `@Injectable` `providedIn` to get a new service instance every time it is injected.
