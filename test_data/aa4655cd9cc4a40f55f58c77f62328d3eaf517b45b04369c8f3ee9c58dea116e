Reading https://github.com/ngx-translate/core/issues/495 led me to try Angular I18n. While checking XLIFF format, it appears that XLIFF 1.2 is pretty old, almost 10 years old and that XLIFF 2+ is not retrocompatible with XLIFF 1.2 ([Source: slide#6](https://www.localizationworld.com/lwdub2014/feisgiltt/slides/Yves_Differences.pdf)).\r\n\r\nHowever, I did not find so many free tools supporting XLIFF 2+ so I might start my project under XLIFF 1.2 hoping that if we need to migrate to XLIFF 2+, it won't be too hurtful.\r\n\r\nI report this as a bug as I assumed that the I18n tooling can generate files that Angular can use 😄 \r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI : 6.0.7\r\nNode        : 8.11.2\r\nOS          : win32 x64 => Windows 10 (version 1803 build 17134.48)\r\nAngular     : 6.0.3\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.6.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.6.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.6.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core              0.6.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        0.6.7\r\n@angular/cli                      6.0.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  6.0.8\r\n@schematics/angular               0.6.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.6.7\r\ntypescript                        2.7.2\r\nwebpack                           4.8.3\r\n<!-- Check whether this is still an issue in the most recent Angular version -->\r\n\r\nBrowser:\r\n- [x] Chrome (desktop) version 66.0.3359.181 x64\r\n- [ ] Chrome (Android) version XX\r\n- [ ] Chrome (iOS) version XX\r\n- [x] Firefox version 60.0.1 x64\r\n- [ ] Safari (desktop) version XX\r\n- [ ] Safari (iOS) version XX\r\n- [ ] IE version XX\r\n- [ ] Edge version XX\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\n<!-- Anything else relevant?

Current behavior\r\n<!-- Describe how the issue manifests. -->\r\nWhen you subscribe to `this.ngForm.valueChanges`, the values you pass into `ngModel` (i.e. `[(ngModel)]=\"user.firstName\"`) are no longer up to date in the `subscribe` callback. (i.e. `user.firstName` would still hold the old value).\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n<!-- Describe what the desired behavior would be. -->\r\nThe values you pass into `ngModel` to have the latest value.

I would expect that in `valueChanges`, my controls have the latest value, which is consistent with Angular 5. I can't think of a reason to change it to the way it is, which makes me believe it's a regression.
