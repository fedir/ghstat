On Firefox,IE this is working fine. But on Chrome browser, even if the file is added, input is still invalid.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nOn google chrome browser input file status should be a 'valid' one, when file is already added.\r\n\r\n## Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions\r\nThis is my stackblitz implementation -\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-5vcajr\r\n\r\n1. Open developer tools while opening on Mozilla Firefox. \r\n2. Focus on 'Browse' through inspector.\r\n3. On input class, these many values could be seen - ng-untouched ng-pristine ng-invalid\r\n4. Add any file(image, pdf etc) through browse option. Focus on 'Browse' through inspector.\r\n5. On input class, these many values could be seen - ng-dirty ng-valid ng-touched\r\n6. Which means after adding file, input status is 'valid' now.\r\n\r\nSame process is done on google chrome browser. On step 5, I could see input class is still 'ng-invalid'.\r\n\r\nThis means, if I apply Validators, it won't work correctly. If I keep a 'submit' button, and it expects input file, to be valid, submit button will never be enabled. It will always be in disabled condition if the formcontrol is set as Validators.required.\r\n\r\n## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\nValidation works perfectly for input type 'text' etc. But it doesn't work for input 'file' type, only in chrome browser. If it works fine in chrome too, then it would be good for developers.\r\n\r\n**Below is stackblitz link for expected behavior. If it is opened in Firefox, then after adding file, submit button is enabled.

short, I have a page with a JS Google map and a control (select dropdown). Let's say that this page is the 3rd page users would get to while following the application flow. After selecting an option from the dropdown (the value for ex, **abc**), they would be navigated through a few more pages before going back to the root page (not by hitting back button or swipe back but directly from the last page, a complete cycle). Everything works well **for the 1st cycle** but now if I try to go through another cycle, I got a problem with the select dropdown in the 3rd page. The value of the select dropdown will stick to the last one (**abc**) that I have chosen in the 1st cycle and wont agree to change no matter which option I switch to. I dont really know if I have missed something and what can be done to fix this. Any help will be really appreciated. Thank you.\r\n\r\nHTML code for the select component:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <select id=\"diemGiaoDichSelected\" (change)=\"diemGiaoDichChanged();\">\r\n            <option value=\"\" disabled selected hidden>Chọn Tỉnh Thành Phố</option>\r\n            <option *ngFor=\"let khuvuc of diemGiaoDich\" [value]=\"khuvuc.code\">{{khuvuc.name}}</option>\r\n          </select>\r\n```\r\nThe function that will be triggered on onchange event, basically I just output the selected value (**x.value**) to the console for testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiemGiaoDichChanged() {\r\n    // this.map.panTo( new google.maps.LatLng( 10, 12 ) );\r\n    var x=document.getElementById('diemGiaoDichSelected') as HTMLSelectElement;\r\n    console.log(x.value);\r\n    let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n      this.loading = this.loadingCtrl.create({\r\n        content: 'Xin Đợi Trong Giây Lát...'\r\n      });\r\n      this.loading.present();\r\n      let apiURL = 'https://api.myjson.com/bins/wsref';\r\n      this.http.get(apiURL)\r\n        .toPromise()\r\n        .then(\r\n        res => { // Success\r\n          this.khuvucTest = res.json().result;\r\n          this.loading.dismiss();\r\n          resolve();\r\n        }\r\n        )\r\n        .catch((error) => {\r\n          this.loading.dismiss();\r\n          alert(\"Không Xử Lý Được!

instructions\r\n<!--\r\nFor bug reports please provide the *STEPS TO REPRODUCE* and if possible a *MINIMAL DEMO* of the problem via\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-gitter).\r\n-->\r\nI ran into this problem while following the instructions on using AngularJS components in an Angular application here: https://angular.io/guide/upgrade.\r\n\r\nI've created a repository that demonstrates the issue here: https://github.com/nfriend/angularjs-in-angular-bug-repro.  Instructions on how to build the application are included in the repository's README.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, here are the steps I took:\r\n\r\n1. Generated a new Angular (v5.2.0) app using the Angular CLI (v1.7.3): `ng new angular-app`\r\n2. Generated a new AngularJS module using a custom Yeoman generator.  Built the module and `npm link`-ed it into the Angular app generated in the previous step.\r\n3. Followed the instructions here to import the AngularJS component into the Angular app and upgrade it: https://angular.io/guide/upgrade#using-angularjs-component-directives-from-angular-code\r\n  - Created a new Angular directive to wrap the AngularJS component:\r\n  \r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { Directive, ElementRef, Injector, SimpleChanges } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { ExampleComponent } from 'angularjs-module';\r\nimport { UpgradeComponent } from '@angular/upgrade/static';\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n    selector: 'upgraded-example-component'\r\n})\r\nexport class ExampleDirective extends UpgradeComponent {\r\n    constructor(elementRef: ElementRef, injector: Injector) {\r\n        super(ExampleComponent.injectionName, elementRef, injector);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  - Imported this directive into my `app.module.ts` and bootstrapped AngularJS in the `ngDoBootstrap` hook:\r\n  \r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\r\nimport { ExampleDirective } from './example-component/example.component';\r\nimport { UpgradeModule } from '@angular/upgrade/static';\r\nimport { angularjsModule } from 'angularjs-module';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    declarations: [AppComponent, ExampleDirective],\r\n    imports: [BrowserModule, UpgradeModule],\r\n    providers: [],\r\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {\r\n    constructor(private upgrade: UpgradeModule) {}\r\n    ngDoBootstrap() {\r\n        this.upgrade.bootstrap(document.body, [angularjsModule], {\r\n            strcitDi: true\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  - Added a reference to my new upgraded directive in `app.component.html`:\r\n  \r\n```html\r\n<upgraded-example-component></upgraded-example-component>\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Built and ran the application.  This caused the following error to be thrown in the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Trying to get the AngularJS injector before it being set.\r\n    at injectorFactory (static.js:694)\r\n    at _callFactory (core.js:10914)\r\n    at _createProviderInstance$1 (core.js:10868)\r\n    at resolveNgModuleDep (core.js:10850)\r\n    at NgModuleRef_.get (core.js:12087)\r\n    at Object.resolveDep (core.js:12577)\r\n    at Injector_.get (core.js:11734)\r\n    at new UpgradeHelper (static.js:809)\r\n    at ExampleDirective.UpgradeComponent (static.js:1114)\r\n    at new ExampleDirective (example.component.ts:10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a real bug or just an issue with the upgrade documentation (https://angular.io/guide/upgrade).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular version: 5.2.0\r\n<!-- Check whether this is still an issue in the most recent Angular version -->\r\n\r\nBrowser:\r\n- [x] Chrome (desktop) version 65.0.3325.181 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n- [?] Chrome (Android) version XX\r\n- [?] Chrome (iOS) version XX\r\n- [x] Firefox version 59.0.2 (64-bit)\r\n- [?] Safari (desktop) version XX\r\n- [?] Safari (iOS) version XX\r\n- [?] IE version XX\r\n- [x] Edge version 40.15063.674.0\r\n \r\nFor Tooling issues:\r\n- Node version: 8.9.1  <!-- run `node --version` -->\r\n- Platform: Windows 10  <!-- Mac, Linux, Windows -->\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\n<!-- Anything else relevant?

Then we came into the catch block, which sets the degraded state. After this we never come back to the normal state. Is this the correct behaviour? Do we really want to switch the state in this way, when we are offline? If the answer is yes, how do we come back to normal state, so that the cache begin to work again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\n<!-- Describe the motivation or the concrete use case. -->\r\n\r\nThe environment of our application has no stable network.

giving error. first it was giving error like run time compiler not found. then we searched about this is found solution like provide compiler in app module's provider. so we did that. now it is giving another error which is not resolving.\r\n-  syntax we have used to provide compiler is like below.\r\n```\r\nimport {Compiler, CompilerFactory, NgModule} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nexport function
