`AppComponent` and `GreeetingComponent`\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  template: '<app-greeting

succeeds.\r\nAlso, `ng build --aot` works well.\r\n\r\nBut at runtime, an error occurs.\r\n\r\n```\r\n_greeting_greeting_component__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__.GreetingComponent.ngComponentDef.h is not a function\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the code. `i1.GreetingComponent.ngComponentDef.h(1, 0);` is an invalid call. `ComponentDef` type doesn't have `h` method. \r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class AppComponent {}\r\n/** @nocollapse */\r\nAppComponent.ctorParameters = () => [];\r\nAppComponent.ngComponentDef = i0.ɵdefineComponent({\r\n  type: AppComponent,\r\n  tag: 'app-root',\r\n  factory: function

What's the expected compilation output? \r\n\r\n## Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions\r\n<!--\r\nFor bug reports please provide the *STEPS TO REPRODUCE* and if possible a *MINIMAL DEMO* of the problem via\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-gitter).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/lacolaco/ngv6-ivy\r\n2. `yarn install`\r\n3. `yarn build`\r\n4 Open `dist` directory in browser with any local server\r\n\r\n## What is the motivation / use case for changing

see https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#question\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\n<!-- Describe how the issue manifests. -->\r\nWhen I tried refreshing a route (example http://localhost:5000/profile) it goes to default fallback page. However I face this issue only after <b>ng build</b>. While developing when I use <b>ng serve</b> this works fine.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n<!-- Describe what the desired behavior would be. -->\r\nAfter <b>ng build</b> when angular & node both are working together on same port. \r\nPage refresh should not take to the default fallback page which is sent by node, instead it should stay where it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions\r\n<!--\r\nFor bug reports please provide the *STEPS TO REPRODUCE* and if possible a *MINIMAL DEMO* of the problem via\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-gitter).\r\n-->\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Create an angular app with a route apart from home route ( say '/profile').</li>\r\n<li>Create a link to '/profile' path in home component in Angular.</li>\r\n<li>Create a node app which will serve /public/index.html as home-route as well as default fallback(I mean when path is not matched with any of existing routes)</li>\r\n<li>run <b>ng build</b> from Angular source folder path on command prompt/terminal. (after 'ng build' output should go to <b><i>&lt;nodeapp folder&gt;/public</i></b>. to achieve this you should change <b><i>outDir</i></b> in <b><i>.angular-cli.json</i></b> to <b><i>&lt;nodeapp folder&gt;/public</i></b>)</li>\r\n<li>Run the node app, go to home, then navigate to profile using link which is created in step 2.</li>\r\n<li>Now try refreshing. <b><i>Instead of staying at profile, it will go to home</i></b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\n<!-- Describe the motivation or the concrete use case. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular version: 5.2.8\r\n<!-- Check whether this is still an issue in the most recent Angular version -->\r\n\r\nBrowser:\r\n- [X] Chrome (desktop) version XX\r\n- [X] Chrome (Android) version XX\r\n- [ ] Chrome (iOS) version XX\r\n- [ ] Firefox version XX\r\n- [ ] Safari (desktop) version XX\r\n- [ ] Safari (iOS) version XX\r\n- [ ] IE version XX\r\n- [ ] Edge version XX\r\n \r\nFor Tooling issues:\r\n- Node version: XX  <!-- run `node --version` -->\r\n- Platform:  <!-- Mac, Linux, Windows -->\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\n<!-- Anything else relevant?  Operating system version, IDE, package manager, HTTP server, ... -->\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nI think when I refresh the page the request is going to node (backend in my case). Shouldn't Angular be able to handle page refresh..? I mean if user is deep somewhere like <a>http://domain/route1/id/route2</a> when refreshed he/she is forced to go to home page(default fallback page.)\r\nIf this is a bug consider this as an issue.\r\nIf this is intended behavior of Angular, kindly consider this as a feature request.\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/22877","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/22877/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/22877/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/22877/events","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/22877","id":306751703,"number":22877,"title":"compiling

 something like this:\r\n`<button _ngcontent-c4=\"\" class=\"btn\" tabindex=\"0\" ng-reflect-router-link=\"/account/order/5aaaa0c6fd20460\">Messages</button>` \r\ninstead\r\n `<button _ngcontent-c4=\"\" class=\"btn\" tabindex=\"0\" ng-reflect-router-link=\"/account/order/5aaaa0c6fd204609b3bd2577/messages\">Messages</button>` with full URL path.\r\n\r\nI tried to use different assigns methods for `routerLink`, but for all of that I got truncated real URL (I put creating URL string in `component.ts` and put only string variable in `routerLink` and other methods like `[routerLink]` creation). For first time it looks like `ng-reflect-router-link` have not enough length. But I try use simple string in href and in DevTools I see normal link like this:\r\n\r\n` <button class=\"btn\" routerLink=\"/123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789\">Messages </button>`\r\n\r\nI get full URL with real length of routerlink and truncated `ng-reflect-router-link`.\r\n\r\n`<button _ngcontent-c4=\"\" class=\"btn\" routerlink=\"/123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789\" tabindex=\"0\" ng-reflect-router-link=\"/12345678912345678912345678912\">Messages</button>`\r\n\r\nWhen I use RouterLink with parameters or variables from component I get only `ng-reflect-router-link` and can't see real link.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\n<!-- Describe the motivation or the concrete use case. -->\r\n\r\nUnder development in some situation getting truncated link prevent understand what real adress you get in view, especially if you use adress with hash or ObjectId parameters.\r\nI think for all links we should see full path or maybe routerlink parameters as for simple string link.\r\n\r\nAnd second, if user have problem with navigate with button (they can't see URL adress on left bottom corner (that not displayed for button)) and if i ask they send me link from devtools - i will get wrong address and can't detect problem.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular version: 5.2.8\r\n<!-- Check whether this is still an issue in the most recent Angular version -->\r\n\r\nBrowser:\r\n- [*] Chrome (desktop) version 65\r\n- [ ] Chrome (Android) version XX\r\n- [ ] Chrome (iOS) version XX\r\n- [*] Firefox version 59\r\n- [ ] Safari (desktop) version XX\r\n- [ ] Safari (iOS) version XX\r\n- [ ] IE version XX\r\n- [ ] Edge version XX\r\n \r\nFor Tooling issues:\r\n- Node version: v8.10.0  <!-- run `node --version` -->\r\n- Platform: Linux (Debian 9.4) <!-- Mac, Linux, Windows -->\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\n<!-- Anything else relevant?
