This is a custom package called 'my-component-library' and we try to lazy load a module from this package like so:\r\n\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'sayheader',\r\n    loadChildren: 'my-component-library#AppModule'\r\n  } \r\n];\r\n\r\nHowever when we do ng-serve --prod I get the following compiler errors:\r\n\r\nERROR in ./src/$$_lazy_route_resource lazy namespace object\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'D:/experiments/LazyLoadingTest/node_modules/my-component-library/my-component-library.ngfactory.js' in 'D:\\experiments\\LazyLoadingTest\\src\\$$_lazy_route_resource'\r\n\r\nng-serve(JIT) also fails with the following error:\r\nModule build failed: Error: D:\\experiments\\LazyLoadingTest\\node_modules\\my-component-library\\my-component-library.d.ts is missing from the TypeScript compilation. Please make sure it is in your tsconfig via the 'files' or 'include' property.\r\n\r\nHowever if I change the routing config like so:\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'sayheader',\r\n   loadChildren: () => new Promise(resolve => {\r\n    (require as any).ensure([], require => {\r\n          resolve(require('my-component-library').AppModule);\r\n      })\r\n   })\r\n  } \r\n];\r\n\r\nand use JIT it works and the module is lazy loaded.\r\n\r\nNote: In Angular 5 the compilation and the lazy loading used to work (JIT and AOT)\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nSuch a configuration needs to work:\r\n\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'sayheader',\r\n    loadChildren: 'my-component-library#AppModule'\r\n  } \r\n];\r\n\r\nwith ng-serve --prod.

Please describe:\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\n<!-- Describe how the issue manifests. -->\r\nWhen building a web extension using Angular for a [browser_action popup window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Popups), any calls to the [background page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/background) fetching an array of objects causes errors when iterating those objects from the Angular app in the popup.\r\n\r\nWhile iterating these objects with `*ngFor=\"let item of items\"`, the following errors are thrown repeatedly in the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR TypeError: Object doesn't support property or method 'Symbol(Symbol.iterator)'\r\nERROR CONTEXT [object Object]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe array still draws to the screen so I am not sure what the errors are being thrown about. These errors do not manifest themselves whenever iterating objects created from the popup window itself.\r\n\r\n**Popup Angular App**\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'app-root',\r\n    template: `\r\n        <div>{{href}}</div><br><br>\r\n        <div *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\r\n            Item: {{item.name}}\r\n        </div>`,\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n    items: any[];\r\n    href: string;\r\n\r\n    private myItems = [\r\n        { name: 'a' },\r\n        { name: 'b' },\r\n        { name: 'c' },\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n    ngOnInit() {\r\n        this.href = window.location.href;\r\n        const bgItems =  browser.extension.getBackgroundPage().myItems;\r\n\r\n        console.log(this.myItems);\r\n        console.log(bgItems);\r\n\r\n        // Uncomment this line to see that iterating objects in Edge has no problem from the popup page itself.\r\n        // this.items = this.myItems;\r\n\r\n        // Uncomment this line to see that getting the same objects from the background page causes errors to occur:\r\n        // ERROR TypeError: Object doesn't support property or method 'Symbol(Symbol.iterator)'\r\n        // ERROR CONTEXT [object Object]\r\n        this.items = bgItems;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst myItems = [\r\n    { name: 'a_bg' },\r\n    { name: 'b' },\r\n    { name: 'c' },\r\n];\r\n\r\n(window as any).myItems = myItems;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the serialization processes between the popup and the background page are causing some sort of loss of object data that Angular is trying to utilize.\r\n\r\nThis only occurs in the Edge browser. I have also tested Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. The others do not manifest this problem.\r\n\r\nTurning on prod mode causes the errors to go away in the console:\r\n\r\n**Popup App `main.js`**\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Enabling prod mode causes the errors to go away, but the performance\r\n// impact of this error are still there.\r\n// enableProdMode();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only workaround I have seen to stop the errors is to clone object arrays after they are fetched from the background page. This re-creates them in the popup window's context.\r\n\r\nSince I am not sure if this is an Angular problem or an Edge problem (maybe both?) I also submitted this problem to Edge's issue tracker here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/16906063/\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n<!-- Describe what the desired behavior would be. -->\r\nBe able to iterate arrays from the background page without error.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions\r\n<!--\r\nFor bug reports please provide the *STEPS TO REPRODUCE* and if possible a *MINIMAL DEMO* of the problem via\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-gitter).\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRepo: https://github.com/kspearrin/angular-ext-edge-bug\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/kspearrin/angular-ext-edge-bug.git\r\ncd angular-ext-edge-bug\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run build:watch\r\n```\r\n\r\nLoad the extension in Edge:\r\n\r\nSettings -> Extension -> Load Extension\r\n\r\nThen open the popup and view the console. Beware: the Edge dev tools for extensions are pretty bad. Very glitchy and often require browser restart to function.\r\n\r\nAnd if you care, my real app that also manifests this problem can be found here: https://github.com/bitwarden/browser\r\n\r\n## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\n<!-- Describe the motivation or the concrete use case. -->\r\nUsing Angular in a web extension for the Edge browser.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular version: 5.2.0\r\n<!-- Check whether this is still an issue in the most recent Angular version -->\r\n\r\nBrowser:\r\n- [ ] Chrome (desktop) version XX\r\n- [ ] Chrome (Android) version XX\r\n- [ ] Chrome (iOS) version XX\r\n- [ ] Firefox version XX\r\n- [ ] Safari (desktop) version XX\r\n- [ ] Safari (iOS) version XX\r\n- [ ] IE version XX\r\n- [x] Edge version 41.16299.371.0\r\n \r\nFor Tooling issues:\r\n- Node version: 9.7.1  <!-- run `node --version` -->\r\n- Platform:  Windows 10<!-- Mac, Linux, Windows -->\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\n<!-- Anything else relevant?

Not necessary for reproducing the issue though.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular version: 5.2.9\r\n\r\nBrowser:\r\n- [x] Chrome (desktop) version 65.0.3325.181 (latest)\r\n\r\nFor Tooling issues:\r\n- Node version: 9.4.0\r\n- Platform:  Linux Ubuntu\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","score":1.0}]}
