I'm submitting a...\r\n\r\n<pre><code>[x] Feature request</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\n\r\nI need to add components in the entryComponents array of a NgModule so I can use it with `ComponentFactoryResolver`:\r\n\r\n`this.componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory<MyComponent>(componentType);`\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAdds a `providesIn` property in the `@Component()` annotation so that it behaves just like `@Injectable()` that, in the new Angular 6 version, doesn't need to be declared in the `providers` array, making it much better both from a performance perspective as well as from a maintenance perspective. In the case of EntryComponents, there wouldn't be a performance gain (because a new instance will always be created and you don't need to declare them in app module), but there is the maintenance gain.\r\n\r\nThen it would be possible to define a component as `@Component( ... providesIn: 'root' )` and use the component as an entry component without defining it in a module. The component code would be included in the modules that use it.\r\n\r\nI don't know how that is done internally tough, but I think there should be a way to implement it similar to how it handles Injectables. \r\n\r\nMaybe the `providesIn` is unnecessary because you don't inject them as services, but creates a new instance always, so the only thing needed was to remove the need to include in the `entryComponents` array.\r\n\r\n## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\n\r\nThe motivation is basically the same as the one to allow services root scoped without having to import them in `AppModule` (or any module).\r\n\r\nHere is an issue I created about providers (services), then I saw in an answer to my request about the new feature about providers (great feature, Angular really needed it for medium and large apps):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/23770#issuecomment-387439265\r\n\r\nAlthough the issue with providers was worse because there is a high probability of wanting to make them as singletons, while with components a new instance will always be created, it makes easy to maintain without including it in the modules that need it (after all, it will be created in an imperative way, and the reference will be known).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Angular version: 6</code></pre>","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/23817","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/23817/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/23817/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/23817/events","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/23817","id":321829068,"number":23817,"title":"To test an Angular Appkliaction, we really do need to have the knowledge of ANgular or just we can go through the Jasmine framework","user":{"login":"donseenugmail","id":39052031,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/39052031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/donseenugmail","html_url":"https://github.com/donseenugmail","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donseenugmail/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donseenugmail/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donseenugmail/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donseenugmail/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donseenugmail/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donseenugmail/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donseenugmail/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donseenugmail/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donseenugmail/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-05-10T06:53:08Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T09:30:14Z","closed_at":"2018-05-10T09:30:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\nPLEASE HELP US PROCESS GITHUB ISSUES FASTER BY PROVIDING THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION.\r\n\r\nISSUES MISSING IMPORTANT INFORMATION MAY BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATION.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## I'm submitting a...\r\n<!-- Check one of the following options with \"x\" -->\r\n<pre><code>\r\n[ ] Regression (a behavior that used to work and stopped working in a new release)\r\n[ ] Bug report  <!-- Please search GitHub for a similar issue or PR before submitting -->\r\n[ ] Performance issue\r\n[ ] Feature request\r\n[ ] Documentation issue or request\r\n[ ] Support request => Please do not submit support request here, instead see https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#question\r\n[ ] Other...
