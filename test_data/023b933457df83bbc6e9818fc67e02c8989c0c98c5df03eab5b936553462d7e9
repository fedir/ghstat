Clone https://github.com/Archcry/micronaut-security-bom-bug-reproduction.git\r\n2. Run `mvn clean compile`\r\n3. Observe the error\r\n\r\n### Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen using the `micronaut bom` (instead of the `micronaut-parent`) and maven central rather than jcentral it should be able to download a version of `ktor-bom`.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behaviour\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to execute goal on project ktor-bug: Could not resolve dependencies for project example.micronaut:ktor-bug:jar:0.1: Failed to collect dependencies at io.micronaut.security:micronaut-security-jwt:jar:2.1.1: Failed to read Failure to find io.ktor:ktor-bom:pom:1.3.2 in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using Maven Central repository in combination with `micronaut-bom` and `micronaut-security` it tries to download version `1.3.2` of `ktor-bom` which does not exist on maven central. The version of `ktor-bom` in `micronaut-bom` is correct (`1.4.0`) but the version of `ktor-bom` in `micronaut-security` dependency management section is causing problems because it is version `1.3.2`.\r\n\r\nMost likely same problem as https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues/3933\r\n\r\n### Environment Information\r\n\r\n- **Operating System**: ArchLinux\r\n- **Micronaut Version:** 2.1.2 (and `micronaut-security:2.1.1`)\r\n- **JDK Version:** OpenJDK 11.0.8 2020-07-14\r\n\r\n### Example Application\r\n\r\n-

For the linked Gradle/Kotlin project however no updates have been merged, the only two that were pushed are upgrades for gradle and a new Docker tag version. I've looked over the logs but couldn't see a reason as to why nothing is created, though the dependency dashboard claims that an upgrade is awaiting status checks and that a bunch of others are open, yet there are no branches or activity from the RenovateBot in the repo. I'm at a bit of a loss since it work in the other two repos I've activated it

Version and Engine Used (client or server and name)**\r\n1.3.2, client, io.ktor.client.features.cache.HttpCache\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nIf a server returns a blank or an invalid Expires HTTP header, the ktor client crashes if the feature HttpCache is enabled `install(HttpCache)`\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Write the following:\r\n```\r\nval articleUrl = Url(\"https://www.nachrichten.at/panorama/weltspiegel/30-jahre-mauerfall-sinnbild-der-freiheit;art17,3184503\")\r\nval newsClient = HttpClient(Apache) {\r\n    install(HttpCache)\r\n\r\n    install(UserAgent) {\r\n        agent = \"Mozilla/5.0\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ntry {\r\n    val call: HttpStatement = newsClient.get(articleSimilarityRequest.articleUrl)\r\n    val response: HttpResponse = call.receive()\r\n    val requestUrl = response.request.url.toString()\r\n    val rawHtml = response.readText()\r\n    println(rawHtml)\r\n} catch (cause: Throwable) {\r\n    println(\"Unable to download article\")\r\n} finally {\r\n    newsClient.close()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. If you open the URL `https://www.nachrichten.at/panorama/weltspiegel/30-jahre-mauerfall-sinnbild-der-freiheit;art17,3184503` in the browser, you can see that the Expires response header is blank\r\n3. An exception is thrown if you run the code:\r\n```\r\n2020-05-23 14:41:24.124 [DefaultDispatcher-worker-2 @request#48] ERROR a.s.api.util.service.DownloadService - Unable to download article\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to parse date: \r\n\tat io.ktor.http.DateUtilsKt.fromHttpToGmtDate(DateUtils.kt:40)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.features.cache.HttpCacheEntryKt.cacheExpires(HttpCacheEntry.kt:84)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.features.cache.HttpCacheEntryKt.HttpCacheEntry(HttpCacheEntry.kt:18)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.features.cache.HttpCacheEntryKt$HttpCacheEntry$1.invokeSuspend(HttpCacheEntry.kt)\r\n\t(Coroutine boundary)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.HttpClient$1.invokeSuspend(HttpClient.kt:123)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.engine.HttpClientEngine$install$1.invokeSuspend(HttpClientEngine.kt:68)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.features.HttpSend$DefaultSender.execute(HttpSend.kt:116)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.features.HttpSend$Feature$install$1.invokeSuspend(HttpSend.kt:79)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.features.HttpCallValidator$Companion$install$1.invokeSuspend(HttpCallValidator.kt:89)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.features.HttpRequestLifecycle$Feature$install$1.invokeSuspend(HttpRequestLifecycle.kt:34)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.HttpClient.execute(HttpClient.kt:164)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.statement.HttpStatement.executeUnsafe(HttpStatement.kt:104)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.statement.HttpStatement.execute(HttpStatement.kt:43)\r\n\tat app.shwoo.api.util.service.DownloadService.downloadArticle$suspendImpl(DownloadService.kt:101)\r\n\tat app.shwoo.api.server.web.SimilarityResourceKt$similarity$1$4.invokeSuspend(SimilarityResource.kt:38)\r\n\tat io.ktor.routing.Routing.executeResult(Routing.kt:147)\r\n\tat io.ktor.routing.Routing.interceptor(Routing.kt:34)\r\n\tat io.ktor.routing.Routing$Feature$install$1.invokeSuspend(Routing.kt:99)\r\n\tat io.ktor.features.ContentNegotiation$Feature$install$1.invokeSuspend(ContentNegotiation.kt:107)\r\n\tat io.ktor.server.testing.TestApplicationEngine$callInterceptor$1.invokeSuspend(TestApplicationEngine.kt:292)\r\n\tat io.ktor.server.testing.TestApplicationEngine$2.invokeSuspend(TestApplicationEngine.kt:50)\r\n\tat io.ktor.server.testing.TestApplicationEngine$handleRequest$pipelineJob$1.invokeSuspend(TestApplicationEngine.kt:290)\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to parse date: \r\n\tat io.ktor.http.DateUtilsKt.fromHttpToGmtDate(DateUtils.kt:40)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.features.cache.HttpCacheEntryKt.cacheExpires(HttpCacheEntry.kt:84)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.features.cache.HttpCacheEntryKt.HttpCacheEntry(HttpCacheEntry.kt:18)\r\n\tat io.ktor.client.features.cache.HttpCacheEntryKt$HttpCacheEntry$1.invokeSuspend(HttpCacheEntry.kt)\r\n\tat kotlin.coroutines.jvm.internal.BaseContinuationImpl.resumeWith(ContinuationImpl.kt:33)\r\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.DispatchedTask.run(DispatchedTask.kt:56)\r\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler.runSafely(CoroutineScheduler.kt:571)\r\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.executeTask(CoroutineScheduler.kt:738)\r\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.runWorker(CoroutineScheduler.kt:678)\r\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.run(CoroutineScheduler.kt:665)\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt seems that the problem occurs in https://github.com/ktorio/ktor/blob/master/ktor-client/ktor-client-core/common/src/io/ktor/client/features/cache/HttpCacheEntry.kt#L84. If the Expires header is blank an exception is thrown. The expected behavior is that the application handles the cache as expired if an invalid date is provided in the HTTP Expires header.

Version and Engine Used (client or server and name)**\r\nKtor 1.3.2, Kotlin 1.3.70, Netty server, ContentNegotiation, Jackson parser, Exposed.\r\n\r\nI simply used the Ktor project generator for Gradle, and checked a few boxes for modules as mentioned above. After which I managed to connect a database & a few endpoints, but my core endpoint for uploading images doesn't work.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen trying to upload a simple image using Retrofit & Multipart support in Android, I get a MalformedInputException on my server.\r\n\r\nRetrofit/Android code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Multipart\r\n@POST(\"/api/upload\")\r\nsuspend fun uploadImages(@Part(\"image\") imageFile: RequestBody): UploadResponse\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpload code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval requestBody: RequestBody = MultipartBody.Builder()\r\n        .setType(MultipartBody.FORM)\r\n        .addFormDataPart(\"title\", \"Image Upload\")\r\n        .addFormDataPart(\r\n            \"image\", // part name\r\n            file.path.split(\"/\").last(), // file name\r\n            file.asRequestBody(\"image/jpg\".toMediaType()) // Content-Type: image/jpg\r\n        )\r\n        .build()\r\n\r\n    return apiService.uploadImages(requestBody)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the new way of creating RequestBody objects in OkHttp. I followed the documentation to receive the multipart data, and I've formed a MalformedInputException.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Use Retrofit to Upload an image to a Ktor server.\r\n2. call `receiveMultipart()` to receive MP on the Ktor side.\r\n3.
