there is no way to create additional dispatchers for element attributes. Up until this point there has not been a need for more that the existing attribute and event use cases. These dispatch on value type. However with newer browser api's (ex. *Observer API's) the ability to dispatch on value type (functions) conflicts with the current `on!` multi-method. There is also no way to developers to provide additional means of dispatching outside of the supported use cases, which makes extending hoplon require core changes.\r\n\r\nThe solution I am proposing is a higher-order multi-method. One that dispatches based on the current namespace dispatching strategy. In this way, namespaces are used to determine which underlying multi-method should attempt to handle the keyword. This allows developers the ability to extend the dispatching strategy and provide additional attribute providers.\r\n\r\nI suggest calling this the `elem!` multi-method:\r\n```\r\n(defmulti elem!\r\n  (fn [elem key & _ ]\r\n    (if-let [n (namespace key)] (keyword n \"*\") key)) :default ::default)\r\n```\r\nDispatchers would then look like:\r\n```\r\n(defmethod elem! :css/*\r\n  [elem key val]\r\n

[6:00 AM] \r\njoined #hoplon.\r\n\r\n\r\nthedavidmeister [2:23 PM] \r\n@flyboarder well it fails :stuck_out_tongue:\r\n\r\n\r\n[2:23] \r\n`:baz/class` overrides `:class` rather than adding to it\r\n\r\n\r\n[2:24] \r\nactually i'm not aware of a good way to build up classes on an element without juggling data structures :disappointed:\r\n\r\n\r\n[2:27] \r\ni often find myself wanting to do something like this\r\n\r\n\r\n[2:27] \r\n ```\r\n(defelem my-basic-foo [_ _] (div :class \"foo\"))\r\n(defelem my-edge-case-foo [_ _] (my-basic-foo :edge-case/class \"edge-case\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n[2:27] \r\nand get back a `div.foo.edge-case`\r\n\r\n\r\nflyboarder [2:57 PM] \r\n@thedavidmeister I'm not sure it should work that way, usually my edge cases grab the existing class before modifying it, that's specific to the edge attribute tho\r\n\r\n\r\n[2:57] \r\nIt makes sense that it overrides it\r\n\r\n\r\nthedavidmeister [2:58 PM] \r\nthat's a lot of boilerplate...\r\n\r\n\r\nflyboarder [2:58 PM] \r\nAs it's a namespaced version of the generic class attribute\r\n\r\n\r\nthedavidmeister [2:58 PM] \r\nwell no, it makes sense that `:class` overrides `:class` but i wouldn't expect `:foo/class` to override `:bar/class`\r\n\r\n\r\nflyboarder \r\n[2:59 PM] \r\nI would depending on the implementation, :foo/class may/may not preserve the existing class\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:00] \r\nSame with :bar/class\r\n\r\n\r\nthedavidmeister [3:00 PM] \r\nthe default implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:01] \r\nit seems a lot more useful to be able to merge classes than have later calls blow away earlier calls\r\n\r\n\r\nflyboarder [3:02 PM] \r\nThat would depend on the CSS lib tho wouldn't it? My thought is that we just can't test for these things and the attribute providers should have proper tests for their implementation. However I see the value in merging the data.\r\n\r\n\r\nthedavidmeister [3:03 PM] \r\nyou can test for your expectations using the implementation provided by hoplon\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:04] \r\nthis isn't about testing the lib\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:04] \r\nthis is about what hoplon does\r\n\r\n\r\nflyboarder [3:04 PM] \r\nRight the default is a \"set\" style\r\n\r\n\r\nthedavidmeister [3:05 PM] \r\nyes, but it calls that \"set\" once for each different `:x/class`\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:06] \r\ni could imagine a hoplon implementation that tracks the classes used for each ns and has the merge behaviour in it\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:06] \r\nusing the same lib\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:07] \r\nit already has some logic around setting `true`/`false` to add/remove classes, so it could probably extend that\r\n\r\n\r\nflyboarder \r\n[3:08 PM] \r\nYeah, ok so that makes sense, if I use a non hoplon element with a :class call I would expect any existing classes to remain, so we should probably be merging\r\n\r\n\r\nthedavidmeister [3:09 PM] \r\nmmm basically\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:09] \r\nthat's what i'm thinking\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:09] \r\nthat it just doesn't touch any classes it doesn't know about\r\n\r\n\r\nflyboarder \r\n[3:09 PM] \r\nYep I'm on track with that\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:10] \r\nCan you open a ticket to remind me :)\r\n\r\n\r\nthedavidmeister [3:10 PM] \r\nsure thing\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:11] \r\n\"merging\" might even be more sophisticated than what i'm suggesting :stuck_out_tongue:\r\n\r\n\r\n[3:11] \r\nit's really just about not blowing away unrelated classes

Hoplon uses repeated classes for making a [grid responsive](https://semantic-ui.com/examples/grid.html):\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"eight wide mobile six wide tablet four wide computer column\" />\r\n```\r\nBut if I try something like that with hoplon, only 1 `wide` class is left, which removes the responsiveness of semantic-ui:\r\n```cljs\r\n(h/div :class [:eight :wide :mobile\r\n               :six :wide :tablet\r\n               :four :wide :computer\r\n               :column])\r\n```\r\nResults in:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"eight wide mobile six tablet four computer column\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks this is because [`normalize-class`](https://github.com/hoplon/hoplon/blob/master/src/hoplon/core.cljs#L62) changes the vector into a map. So my question is, how can I accomplish multiple repeated (`wide`) class-names on the same element?\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/hoplon/issues/192","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/hoplon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/hoplon/issues/192/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/hoplon/issues/192/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/hoplon/issues/192/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hoplon/hoplon/issues/192","id":239995728,"number":192,"title":"cljs 1.9.660+ -

A selenium based approach would require maintaining two near-identical pages to be served/tested against, one with jquery and one with goog.\r\n\r\ncons:\r\n- selenium does have handy functions for triggering browser events that may need to be re-implemented to some extent for convenience (although jQuery helps a _lot_ here with `trigger()`)\r\n- some browser behaviour is inconsistent between detached elements and those that are appended to the document. These problems are usually not too hard to spot (because the detached behaviour is just nonsensical, like events completely failing to bubble) and elements can still be attached/detached to the document manually in cljs tests.\r\n- selenium style testing is better at end-to-end testing than cljs, but this type of testing seems inappropriate for the Hoplon framework itself, you might want to use it in a specific app though\r\n- selenium is a much more natural fit for testing things like navigation/routing as it expects tests to span multiple page loads","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/hoplon/issues/190","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/hoplon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/hoplon/issues/190/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/hoplon/issues/190/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hoplon/hoplon/issues/190/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hoplon/hoplon/issues/190","id":239552921,"number":190,"title":"Attribute IFn","user":{"login":"flyboarder","id":147004,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/147004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyboarder","html_url":"https://github.com/flyboarder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyboarder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/us
