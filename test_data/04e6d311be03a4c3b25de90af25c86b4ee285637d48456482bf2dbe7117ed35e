is only recognized when the application is run by the JAR like this `java -classpath classpathtest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ro.pippo.classpathtest.PippoLauncher`\r\n- `ControllerB` is not recognized when the application is started by an IDE, Eclipse for example, or via the command line with `mvn clean compile exec: java`\r\n\r\n### Where's the problem?\r\nHere: [ro.pippo.controller.util.ClassUtils.getClasses(String...)](https://github.com/pippo-java/pippo/blob/release-1.12.0/pippo-controller-parent/pippo-controller/src/main/java/ro/pippo/controller/util/ClassUtils.java#L70)\r\n\r\nIn JAR mode [`if`](https://github.com/pippo-java/pippo/blob/release-1.12.0/pippo-controller-parent/pippo-controller/src/main/java/ro/pippo/controller/util/ClassUtils.java#L77) is executed and in non-JAR

difference in the result of the method.\r\n\r\nThe size of this method seems strange to me, but I haven't looked at it yet.\r\n\r\n### Sample project\r\nhttps://github.com/mhagnumdw/classpathtest\r\n\r\n### Reproduce\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/mhagnumdw/classpathtest.git\r\ncd classpathtest/\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Bad things here (IDE version)\r\n```bash\r\nmvn clean compile exec:java\r\n# or via IDE: Eclipse\r\n```\r\n- It works: http://localhost:8338/a\r\n- **Does not work:** http://localhost:8338/b\r\n\r\n#### Everything is beautiful here (JAR version)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmvn clean package\r\ncd target\r\njava -classpath classpathtest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ro.pippo.classpathtest.PippoLauncher\r\n```\r\n- It

this method is `privat`e and the modification is simple.\r\nThe impact is big. You can control how an application instance is created (by default an application instance is created using `applicationClassName` init parameter supplied in `web.xml`).\r\nFor example, this modification allows me to use a `PippoApplication` defined as Spring bean in Spring configuration.\r\n\r\nThe steps are:\r\n- create a custom filter that knows how to retrieves the Pippo application bean from Spring\r\n```java\r\npublic class SpringPippoFilter extends PippoFilter {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void createApplication(FilterConfig filterConfig) {\r\n        ServletContext servletContext = filterConfig.getServletContext();\r\n        ApplicationContext applicationContext = WebApplicationContextUtils.getWebApplicationContext(servletContext);\r\n        Application application = (Application) applicationContext.getBean(\"pippoApplication\");\r\n        setApplication(application);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- define Pippo application as bean in Spring configuration\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic SpringConfig {\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public FrontendApplication pippoApplication() {\r\n        return new FrontendApplication();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public ProductService productService() {\r\n        return new DefaultProductService();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // other beans injected via @Autowire in pippoApplication\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- inject in your Pippo application other components managed by Spring (for example `ProductService` in my case)\r\n```java\r\n@Component\r\npublic class FrontendApplication extends Application {\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private ProductService productService;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void onInit() {\r\n        getRouter().ignorePaths(\"/admin\"); // Wicket application\r\n\r\n        // send 'Hello World' as response\r\n        GET(\"/\", routeContext -> routeContext.send(\"Hello World\"));\r\n\r\n        GET(\"/products\", routeContext -> routeContext.text().send(productService.count()));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- specify where Spring keeps configuration (`SpringConfig` in our case) and specify that I want to use my custom filter `SpringPippoFilter` instead of default `PippoFilter` (that comes with `pippo-core`)\r\n[web.xml]\r\n```xml\r\n    <context-param>\r\n        <param-name>contextClass</param-name>\r\n        <param-value>org.springframework.web.context.support.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext</param-value>\r\n    </context-param>\r\n\r\n    <context-param>\r\n        <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>\r\n        <param-value>SpringConfig</param-value>\r\n    </context-param>\r\n\r\n    <filter>\r\n        <filter-name>pippo.filter</filter-name>\r\n        <filter-class>SpringPippoFilter</filter-class>\r\n    </filter>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSure this modification is not valuable is you don't use the `web.xml` standard descriptor file to specify your Pippo application.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pippo-java/pippo/issues/519","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pippo-java/pippo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pippo-java/pippo/issues/519/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pippo-java/pippo/issues/519/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pippo-java/pippo/issues/519/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pippo-java/pippo/issues/519","id":457417652,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTc0MTc2NTI=","number":519,"title":"Bug

get a SessionData object from cookie,pippo base64 decode the PIPPO_SESSION,and then deserialize the decoded data(the decoded data is a serialized SessionData object);\r\nHowever,ObjectInputStream.readObject() leads to a Java deserialization vulnerability.\r\nThe Apache Shiro framework used to have a similar issue(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-550).\r\nThere exists a gadget chain in jre8u20,we can generate the attack payload based on it;Here is a blog(https://www.anquanke.com/post/id/87270) about the generating procedure,I am sorry it's writed in Chinese,or get the payload by tool(https://github.com/360-A-Team/SerialWriter) ;So,if the version lowwer than jre8u20,it may leads to a remote code execution;\r\nFor details,please refer to the picture below：\r\n![demo1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8623936/46254251-d28bae80-c4be-11e8-8f94-e6ac49a969bf.jpg)\r\nThe payload I used is as follows:\r\n[jre8u20payload_base64.txt](https://github.com/pippo-java/pippo/files/2431312/jre8u20payload_base64.txt)\r\nAnd some third party modules also have a gadget chain;\r\nTo fix the issue,we can implement a class FilteringObjectInputStream,and replace ObjectInputStream with it,The implementation of FilterObjectInputStream is as follows:\r\n```java\r\npublic class FilteringObjectInputStream extends ObjectInputStream {\r\n   public FilteringObjectInputStream(InputStream in) throws IOException {\r\n      super(in);\r\n   }\r\n   protected Class<?> resolveClass(java.io.ObjectStreamClass descriptor) throws ClassNotFoundException, IOException {\r\n      String className = descriptor.getName();\r\n      ClassFilter classFilter=new ClassFilter();\r\n      if(className != null && className.length() > 0 && !classFilter.isWhiteListed(className)) {\r\n         throw new InvalidClassException(\"Unauthorized deserialization attempt\", descriptor.getName());\r\n      } else {\r\n         return super.resolveClass(descriptor);\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\npublic class ClassFilter {\r\n       private ArrayList<String> WhiteList= null;      \r\n       public ClassFilter() {\r\n    \t       WhiteList=new ArrayList<String>();\r\n    \t\t   WhiteList.add(\"ro.pippo.session.SessionData\");\r\n    \t\t   WhiteList.add(\"java.util.HashMap\");\r\n    \t\t   WhiteList.add(\"ro.pippo.core.Flash\");\r\n    \t\t   WhiteList.add(\"java.util.ArrayList\");\r\n        }\r\n       public  boolean isWhiteListed(String className) {\r\n    \t   if(className==null) return false;\r\n    \t   for(String name:WhiteList) {\r\n    \t\t   if(name.equals(className)) return true;\r\n    \t   }\r\n\t\t   return false;\r\n       }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt's just a demo.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pippo-java/pippo/issues/448","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pippo-java/pippo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pippo-java/pippo/issues/448/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pippo-java/pippo/issues/448/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pippo-java/pippo/issues/448/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pippo-java/pippo/issues/448","id":360958378,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjA5NTgzNzg=","number":448,"title":"Fix
