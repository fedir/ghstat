action, and is used to save the session when rendering is finished. \r\n\r\nDuring debugging, I found out, that the constructor of \"\\Cake\\Network\\Session\" calls \"session_set_save_handler\" with the engine object created at construction.\r\nBut when replacing the engine, the PHP function is not called to provide the new engine object.\r\nCalling \"session_set_save_handler\" after passing the

That fails with: `Failed asserting that a string is empty.`\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n\r\nI didn't expect it to fail.

I'm not sure if this is a failure in my code, the `Response` object, the assert method, or a combination.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11826","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11826/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11826/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11826/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11826","id":305325317,"number":11826,"title":"PagedResultSet","user":{"login":"xaphalanx","id":41106,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/41106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaphalanx","html_url":"https://github.com/xaphalanx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaphalanx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaphalanx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaphalanx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaphalanx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaphalanx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaphalanx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaphalanx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaphalanx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaphalanx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":60504144,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/labels/Enhancement","name":"Enhancement","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-03-14T20:56:02Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T21:03:52Z","closed_at":"2018-03-14T21:03:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [ ] bug\r\n* [x] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.x\r\n* Platform and Target: Not Relevant.\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nI need to get a paged results but not in controller context, in a service layer context.\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nI was writing a service layer object and needed to page results and I wanted total number of pages and other details currently stored in the paginator and passed to the view through the request object in the data/table layer. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nIt would be great to have a specialized ResultSet object returned, PagedResultSet, that had properties or methods that have page counts and so forth stored in them.

In order to do that I set the emailFormat to 'both'. Here the code how I send the email.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$email = new Email($this->_transport());\r\n$email->from([$this->_from => $this->_name])\r\n\t->template('myEmail')\t\r\n\t->helpers(['InlineCss'])\r\n\t->viewVars(['firstname' => 'Kirk'])\r\n        ->to($to)\r\n        ->subject($subject)\r\n\t->emailFormat('both')\r\n        ->send();\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy templates and layouts structure:\r\n\r\n## Templates:\r\n\r\n**src/Template/Email/html/myEmail.ctp**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"content\">\r\n\t<h1>\r\n\t\t<?php echo htmlentities('Hello ' . $firstname); ?>\r\n\t</h1>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**src/Template/Email/text/myEmail.ctp**\r\n\r\n`<?php echo htmlentities('Hello ' . $firstname); ?>`\r\n\r\n## Layouts:\r\n\r\n**src/Template/Api/V1/Layout/Email/html/default.ctp**\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\">\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n    <title><?= $this->fetch('title') ?></title>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n    <div class=\"main\">\r\n         <?= $this->fetch('content') ?>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"footer\">\r\n         <?php echo htmlentities('Copywrite © 2018 Name here'); ?>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**src/Template/Api/V1/Layout/Email/text/default.ctp**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$this->fetch('content');\r\n-----------\r\necho \"\\n\";\r\necho htmlentities('Copywrite © 2018 Name here');\r\n\r\n?>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI send the email from a controller which is also in the V1 structure. \r\n`src/Controller/Api/V1/EmailController.php`\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the text email has not the content from the template included. So it's just the layout without the content of **src/Template/Email/text/myEmail.ctp**. So it would look like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n -------\r\nCopywrite © 2018 Name here\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe html email works as expected. Also when I try to switch to the emailFormat('text') it does not work. I digg into the Cakephp code and found out that on the following line he wipes out the content for the text email.\r\n\r\n**vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/View/View.php (1164)**\r\n`$content = $this->_evaluate($viewFile, $data);`\r\n\r\nAlso I'm wondering why I don't have to add a structure for the templates like I did for the layout. I mean like **src/Template/Api/V1/Email/text/default.ctp**. But that's just a minor question cause the code is grabbing the right template.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nThe text email should behave like the html email does.\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11818","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11818/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11818/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11818/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11818","id":304399635,"number":11818,"title":"Security:

is a:\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [x] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.5.12 #a6c47f15e2dfbb062fcc547d6eecd0a944dc8b17.\r\n* Platform and Target: nginx 1.10.3, MariaDB 10.0.31, PHP 7.0.22-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nOur application was PEN-tested and their requests containing the below XML example did not pass inspection.\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nParse the following XML using `XML::build`:\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE item [\r\n  <!ENTITY item \"item\">\r\n  <!ENTITY item1 \"&item;&item;&item;&item;&item;&item;\">\r\n  <!ENTITY item2 \"&item1;&item1;&item1;&item1;&item1;&item1;&item1;&item1;&item1;\">\r\n  <!ENTITY item3 \"&item2;&item2;&item2;&item2;&item2;&item2;&item2;&item2;&item2;\">\r\n  <!ENTITY item4 \"&item3;&item3;&item3;&item3;&item3;&item3;&item3;&item3;&item3;\">\r\n  <!ENTITY item5 \"&item4;&item4;&item4;&item4;&item4;&item4;&item4;&item4;&item4;\">\r\n  <!ENTITY item6 \"&item5;&item5;&item5;&item5;&item5;&item5;&item5;&item5;&item5;\">\r\n  <!ENTITY item7 \"&item6;&item6;&item6;&item6;&item6;&item6;&item6;&item6;&item6;\">\r\n  <!ENTITY item8 \"&item7;&item7;&item7;&item7;&item7;&item7;&item7;&item7;&item7;\">\r\n]>\r\n<item>\r\n  <description>&item8;</description>\r\n</item>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nWhen interchanging the item in the <description> tag the memory used for parsing peaks depending on the index used. Using `&item8;` is very noticeable. On our production servers a request using this XML body takes 8 seconds to respond.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the following:\r\n- The RequestHandlerComponent uses `Xml::build` in its `convertXml` function with default options.\r\n- Default build options prevent entity expansion using `libxml_disable_entity_loader` but as mentioned in the PHP docs, this only handles loading of *external* entities.\r\n\r\n### What probably should happen\r\n- The default return type of `XML::_loadXml` is SimpleXML. There is no parameter to prevent SimpleXML from loading internal entity references, making it increase server load.\r\n- If I load the above example into a  `\\DOMDocument` object with the libxml entity loader disabled, it gives the following warning:\r\n```\r\nPHP Warning:  DOMDocument::loadXML(): Detected an entity reference loop in Entity, line: 1 in ~/Desktop/tst.php on line 5\r\n```\r\n- Loading of the XML remains fast using DOMDocument, there are however no childNodes present because of the warning given. In this case, DOMDocument should probably be preferred with regard to SimpleXML. \r\n\r\n### How did I temporarily solve this?\r\nI extended the `RequestHandlerComponent::convertXml` with the following:\r\n```php\r\npublic function convertXml($xml)\r\n{\r\n    try {\r\n        $xml = Xml::build($xml, ['readFile' => false, 'return' => 'domdocument']);\r\n        if ($xml->childNodes->length > 0) {\r\n            return Xml::toArray($xml);\r\n        }\r\n        return [];\r\n    } catch (XmlException $e) {\r\n        return [];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11817","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11817/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11817/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11817/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11817","id":304310060,"number":11817,"title":"3.6.0-beta2 - Deprecation warning displays incorrect method name","user":{"login":"sdustinh","id":2855100,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2855100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh","html_url":"https://github.com/sdustinh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":742268651,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/labels/deprecations","name":"deprecations","color":"0e0566","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/milestones/140","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/milestone/140","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/milestones/140/labels","id":2671072,"number":140,"title":"3.6.0","description":"New major features that are backwards compatible with 3.x.
