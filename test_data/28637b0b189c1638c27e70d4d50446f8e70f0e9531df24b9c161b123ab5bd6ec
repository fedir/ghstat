able to setup tables on database with table custom names and I set up all those names in initialize method of all my tables.\r\nFo example I  have a table called COMPANY_attachments_i18n and all other table follow the same table name convention.\r\nAll model works fine with custo table name but the translation of such table always search for the lowercase underscored version of the table.\r\nIn the docs there is the following sentence **\"No inflection conventions will be applied when specifying a table.\"** but TranslateBehavior or something like that will do the inflectiob with the result that I had to be forced to change table name to original format.\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nas in the above mentioned example the TranslateBehavior search for underscore lowercase version of the table COMPANY_attachments_i18n breaking it \r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI expect that translate behavior will trait the table the correctly without inflecting it \r\nP.S.

Do I need some sort of specific locale setting for these tests to pass? It's obviously passing in travis, and I noticed there is a step to do `sudo locale-gen da_DK`, is that related? Or is this strictly due to my version of php-intl or C libs being different somehow.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it looks like in this line: https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/tests/TestCase/I18n/DateTest.php#L77 two arguments are passed to `FrozenDate` however only the 1st argument is ever used. Could the 2nd argument just be deleted?\r\n\r\nThanks 😄 ","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12155","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12155/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12155/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12155/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12155","id":327842813,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjc4NDI4MTM=","number":12155,"title":"Modelless form set value is impossible without setter","user":{"login":"duoorases","id":16020182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDIwMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16020182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoorases","html_url":"https://github.com/duoorases","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoorases/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoorases/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoorases/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoorases/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoorases/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoorases/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoorases/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoorases/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoorases/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":60600135,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MDYwMDEzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/labels/Question","name":"Question","color":"207de5","default":false},{"id":60504893,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MDUwNDg5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"FFFFFF","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/milestones/172","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/milestone/172","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/milestones/172/labels","id":3360005,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzM2MDAwNQ==","number":172,"title":"3.6.5","description":"Bugfixes for 3.6.x","creator":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":32,"closed_issues":49,"state":"open","created_at":"2018-05-21T02:30:44Z","updated_at":"2018-06-08T17:50:24Z","due_on":"2018-06-09T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-05-30T18:13:42Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T20:59:47Z","closed_at":"2018-05-30T19:19:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [ ] bug\r\n* [x] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: EXACT RELEASE VERSION OR COMMIT HASH, HERE.\r\n* Platform and Target: YOUR WEB-SERVER, DATABASE AND OTHER RELEVANT INFO AND HOW THE REQUEST IS BEING MADE, HERE.\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nRef: https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-libraries/form.html#setting-form-values\r\nA filter is using modelless form.

fatal with a query that had nothing after the WHERE and was invalid SQL because of that.
