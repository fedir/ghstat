is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] enhancement\r\n* [x] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\nThere is one thing I miss a lot about CakePHP version 2.x. Previously not just the controllers, but the tables, helpers and components, if I'm not mistaken, were inheritances of an APP class that inherited from the Framework class (AppTable, AppComponent, AppHelper). This is very useful since it makes super easy to make customizations for all project items of that type. Today it is still possible to do this manually, but every time baker is used, I have to edit the class to correct the inheritance. I think it would be a very useful thing.

you did\r\nUpgrade CakePHP to version 3.6\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nMy project is in a subfolder 'project', so my URLs are e.g. /project/users/login for controller 'users' and action 'login'.\r\n\r\nIn webroot/.htaccess I do the rewrite:\r\n```\r\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\r\n    RewriteEngine On\r\n    RewriteBase /project\r\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\r\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\r\n    RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]\r\n</IfModule>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use the SecurityComponent to protect POST data against forgery.\r\nWhen I submit the form I get an error \r\n\"URL mismatch in POST data (expected '/project/users/login' but found '/users/login')\"\r\nSo far I figured out that the SecurityHelper constructs the 'url' part of the token including the base folder, i.e. '/project/users/login', but that the SecurityComponent checks against `request->getRequestTarget()`, which returns the URL without the base folder, i.e. '/users/login'.\r\n\r\nIn 3.5 the URL was checked against `request->here()`, which seems to include the folder as well by default.\r\n`ServerRequest::here` has an optional parameter $base, by default true, but `ServerRequest::getRequestTarget` does not have this parameter. \r\nThough it is recommended to replace here with `getRequestTarget` this may not always be possible.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nNo error, of course :)\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.
