Fix coming!\r\n\r\n**- If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nThis is hard, I stumbled upon it while testing locally. Haven't found any example in the demo that shows this. The *ListControl* component was using the `forID` property to check for metadata that has a structure like \r\n```\r\n{ \"collection_name\": { ... } }\r\n```\r\nbut the changes to ensure `forID` uniqueness breaks this of course as the metadata doesn't have that unique string in the object's property names.\r\n\r\nPR with fix coming!","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1196","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1196/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1196/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1196/events","html_url":"https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1196","id":308755457,"number":1196,"title":"uploaded filenames not being slugified  ","user":{"login":"thauvette","id":7917553,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7917553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thauvette","html_url":"https://github.com/thauvette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thauvette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thauvette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thauvette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thauvette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thauvette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thauvette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thauvette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thauvette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thauvette/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":783333654,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/area:%20asset-management","name":"area: asset-management","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":846258457,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/area:%20file-handling","name":"area: file-handling","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":783294712,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/claimed","name":"claimed","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":783215331,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/kind:%20enhancement","name":"kind: enhancement","color":"E8CAAF","default":false},{"id":783203547,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/status:%20confirmed","name":"status: confirmed","color":"c2e0c6","default":false},{"id":783207566,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/status:%20needs%20attention","name":"status: needs attention","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"tech4him1","id":20345941,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20345941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1","html_url":"https://github.com/tech4him1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tech4him1","id":20345941,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20345941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1","html_url":"https://github.com/tech4him1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tech4him1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2018-03-26T22:19:15Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T22:56:49Z","closed_at":"2018-03-27T22:56:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\nIf you are reporting a new issue, make sure that we do not have any duplicates\r\nalready open.
