I'm migrating a wordpress blog with about 150 posts to Netlify CMS. I've started with the Gatsby starter project, and after converting my posts to Markdown, I dropped them in the \"blog\" folder for the blog collection. After deploying to Netlify, I see that Gatsby has built the static files correctly, but when I log into the CMS, none of my old posts appear under the blog collection. I'm completely new to Netlify CMS so I apologize if I'm missing something obvious. I really love the idea of this project and look forward to contributing further once I get my feet wet a little bit.\r\n\r\n**- Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**- What is the current behavior?**\r\nMarkdown files manually added to my collection's folder and committed to Git, do not appear in the CMS.\r\n\r\n**- What is the expected behavior?**\r\nProperly formatted Markdown files added to collection folders should appear in the CMS.\r\n\r\n**- Please mention your versions where applicable.**\r\nNetlify CMS version: 1.7.0\r\nBrowser version: Chrome 66\r\n\r\n**- Please link or paste your `config.yml` below if applicable.**\r\n\r\n```\r\nbackend:\r\n  name: git-gateway\r\n  branch: master\r\n\r\nmedia_folder: static/img\r\npublic_folder: /img\r\npublish_mode: editorial_workflow\r\n\r\ncollections:\r\n  -

I only wanted to verify that providing a string for this parameter solves the first issue:\r\n```javascript\r\nexports.modifyWebpackConfig = ({ config, stage }) => {\r\n  if (stage === \"build-javascript\") {\r\n    config.loader(\"cms-css\", current => {\r\n      const opts = current.loader[0].options;\r\n      const str = `{\"id\":${opts.id}, \"remove\":${opts.remove}, \"omit\":${\r\n        opts.omit\r\n      }}`;\r\n\r\n      return {\r\n        test: current.test,\r\n        include: current.include,\r\n        loader: `${current.loader[0].loader}?${str}!css`\r\n      };\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThe above allows webpack to progress further but causes other issues, probably because I'm only outputting the one loader. I will probably try to convert it to use the `loaders` param next, to see if that solves all problems.\r\n\r\nI can try provide more info/help if anyone else is getting this is is able to reproduce.\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1316","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1316/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1316/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1316/events","html_url":"https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1316","id":317180707,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTcxODA3MDc=","number":1316,"title":"CSS of the authentication button text","user":{"login":"severo","id":1676121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzYxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1676121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo","html_url":"https://github.com/severo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":794287417,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3OTQyODc0MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/area:%20ui","name":"area: ui","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":168064400,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjgwNjQ0MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/kind:%20bug","name":"kind: bug","color":"FF8C94","default":false},{"id":783203547,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODMyMDM1NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/status:%20confirmed","name":"status: confirmed","color":"c2e0c6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-24T11:19:20Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T14:23:55Z","closed_at":"2018-04-24T14:23:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!--\r\nIf you are reporting a new issue, make sure that we do not have any duplicates\r\nalready open.

Yet, on any freshly deployed Netlify websites, the Netlify CMS isn't working for me, at all.\r\n\r\nI'm going to try adding a custom domain to these new instances, since that is the only difference I can think of between the new projects and the old, working one.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the included screenshots for the error messages.\r\n\r\n**INFO:**\r\n\r\nNetlify CMS version 1.5.0\r\nClient-side Node: v8.11.0\r\nNetlify-side Node: node v8.11.1 (npm v5.6.0)\r\nOS: Fedora 26 (x86-64)\r\n\r\n**- Please link or paste your `config.yml` below if applicable.**\r\n\r\n(I don't think this is an issue with the config.yml, but here it is just in case I made an obvious mistake?)\r\n\r\n```\r\nbackend:\r\n\r\n  name: git-gateway\r\n  branch: master # Branch to update (optional; defaults to master)\r\n\r\nmedia_folder: \"img\"\r\n\r\ncollections:\r\n\r\n  - name: \"special-pages\"\r\n    label: \"Pages uniques\"\r\n    delete: false # Prevent users from deleting documents in this collection\r\n    files:\r\n      - name: \"home\"\r\n        file: \"index.md\"\r\n        label: \"Éditer la page d'accueil\"\r\n        fields:\r\n          - {label: \"Layout\", name: \"layout\", widget: \"hidden\", default: \"home\"}\r\n          - {label: \"Title\", name: \"title\", widget: \"string\"}\r\n          - {label: \"Permalink\", name: \"permalink\", widget: \"hidden\", default: \"/\" }\r\n          - {label: \"Description\", name: \"description\", widget: \"string\"}\r\n          - {label: \"Paragraphe d'introduction\", name: \"home_intro\", widget: \"markdown\"}\r\n          - {label: \"Paragraphe pour matériel premier soins\", name: \"home_materiel\", widget: \"markdown\"}\r\n          - {label: \"Lien vers matériel premier soins\", name: \"link_materiel\", widget: \"string\"}\r\n          - {label: \"Paragraphe pour formations\", name: \"home_formations\", widget: \"markdown\"}\r\n          - {label: \"Lien vers formations\", name: \"link_formations\", widget: \"string\"}\r\n```","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1271","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1271/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1271/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1271/events","html_url":"https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1271","id":314602147,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTQ2MDIxNDc=","number":1271,"title":"Datetime widget is wrapping date in single quotes","user":{"login":"charlotte-l","id":18618796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjE4Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18618796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlotte-l","html_url":"https://github.com/charlotte-l","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlotte-l/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlotte-l/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlotte-l/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlotte-l/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlotte-l/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlotte-l/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlotte-l/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlotte-l/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlotte-l/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":783287693,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODMyODc2OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/area:%20extensions/widgets","name":"area: extensions/widgets","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":168064400,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjgwNjQ0MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/kind:%20bug","name":"kind: bug","color":"FF8C94","default":false},{"id":773713641,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NzM3MTM2NDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":783203547,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODMyMDM1NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/status:%20confirmed","name":"status: confirmed","color":"c2e0c6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2018-04-16T11:04:26Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T16:03:45Z","closed_at":"2018-05-25T16:03:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**- Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug\r\n\r\n**- What is the current behavior?**\r\nDates generated by the Datetime widget are wrapped in single quotes in the document's front matter.\r\nExample: \r\n`date: '2018-03-21T11:14:49+00:00'`\r\n\r\n**- If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n1.
