I will probably try to convert it to use the `loaders` param next, to see if that solves all problems.\r\n\r\nI can try provide more info/help if anyone else is getting this is is able to reproduce.\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1316","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1316/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1316/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1316/events","html_url":"https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1316","id":317180707,"number":1316,"title":"CSS of the authentication button text","user":{"login":"severo","id":1676121,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1676121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo","html_url":"https://github.com/severo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":794287417,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/area:%20ui","name":"area: ui","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":168064400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/kind:%20bug","name":"kind: bug","color":"FF8C94","default":false},{"id":783203547,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/status:%20confirmed","name":"status: confirmed","color":"c2e0c6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-24T11:19:20Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T14:23:55Z","closed_at":"2018-04-24T14:23:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!--\r\nIf you are reporting a new issue, make sure that we do not have any duplicates\r\nalready open.
