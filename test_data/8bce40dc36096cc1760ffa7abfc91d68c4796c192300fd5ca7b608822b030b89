Please describe.**\r\nThere are many ways to start puma across both Rails and Sinatra apps. It can be confusing and frustrating trying to come up with a good solution that is consistent across applications and  consistent with community best practices.\r\n\r\nOn Rails, should you start with `$ puma -C config/puma.rb` or `$ rails s`?  I think it's clear because the README nicely states the following:\r\n\r\n> It is recommended that you use Puma's executable instead.\r\n\r\nBut, On Sinatra, when you ask the question if you should start with `$ puma -C config/puma.rb` or `$ ruby app.rb -s Puma` or `rackup` the answer is not as clear.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've experienced upgrading a dozen or more Rails and Sinatra apps to run on Docker/Kubernetes, it feels like starting with `bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb` across both platforms is the more consistent approach. It makes for a consistent startup be it Procfile, CMD in a Dockerfile, or bash/cli. Also, the puma config file becomes a consistent place to control Puma ports, env and threads. Yet the Puma README suggests starting on Sinatra with `$ ruby app.rb -s Puma`. Is that the preferred approach for Sinatra? If so, why? what are the benefits of starting an sinatra/puma app that way vs with `puma -C`? The downside appears to be having to put config for ports and such inside the sinatra configure blocks are on the command line.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAn ideal solution would update the README to be authoritative on how to start Sinatra apps.  If `$ ruby app.rb -s Puma` is the preferred, what makes it so?\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've read through Sinatra docs and Puma docs/issues/code and do not have a clear understanding yet.  For example, this 3 year old comment gives some context on using `$ ruby app.rb -s Puma`:\r\n\r\n> Sinatra doesnt typically use rackup files (which is why the README says to use ruby app.rb -s Puma).\r\nhttps://github.com/puma/puma/issues/1465#issuecomment-345719511\r\n\r\nBut, this comment then calls out starting puma directly\r\n\r\n> You should be using bundle exec puma, not bundle exec rackup.\r\nhttps://github.com/puma/puma/issues/13#issuecomment-316473258\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI understand there are many options and choices and trade-offs for all. With many devs coming to Puma through Rails, having strong conventions can be helpful to onboard.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/issues/1919","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/issues/1919/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/issues/1919/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/issues/1919/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/issues/1919","id":726582844,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MjY1ODI4NDQ=","number":1919,"title":"Asynchronously created instances become stuck in \"create in progress\" when creation is cancelled but broker does not support cancelling","user":{"login":"ionphractal","id":16098792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk4Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16098792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionphractal","html_url":"https://github.com/ionphractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionphractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionphractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionphractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionphractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionphractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionphractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionphractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionphractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionphractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":371017948,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzEwMTc5NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"75B000","default":false,"description":null},{"id":996428759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTY0Mjg3NTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/labels/sapi","name":"sapi","color":"84c43a","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-10-21T15:09:00Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T17:53:26Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T16:13:48Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Issue\r\n\r\nWhen using an asynchronous service broker which does not support cancellation of operations, a service instance becomes stuck in \"create in progress\" when the service instance is deleted before the creation succeeded.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nAt some point CC started to support the cancellation of create operations: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/commit/ff4ee3dbc85a755e762fc8d5ec03f0caef1c64ca\r\n\r\nThe openservicebroker specification states that the broker can return `422 Unprocessable Entity` \"if the Service Instance is being processed by some other operation and therefore cannot be deleted at this time\". (https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md#deprovisioning)\r\n\r\nThere may be some service brokers that can handle cancellation of creation but this cannot be ensured. So the Cloud Controller should handle these situations by disallowing the deprovisioning and allowing the provisioning to finish.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n* have a cf-deployment at hand\r\n* have a broker that provisions asynchronously (and takes a while to provision)\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. create a service instance asynchronously\r\n`cf create-service async-service plan test`\r\n2. delete the service while in \"create in progress\"\r\n`cf delete-service test`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected result\r\n\r\nThe delete command should fail and the service should become \"create succeeded\" at some point.\r\n\r\n## Current result\r\n\r\nThe CC returns `Server error, status code: 409, error code: 60016, message: An operation for service instance test is in progress.` and it logs a CF-AsyncServiceInstanceOperationInProgress backtrace in the log (see below).\r\n\r\nHowever, the service instance is stuck in \"create in progress\" forever because the broker_provided_operation column is emptied.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"description\": \"An operation for service instance test is in progress.\",\r\n  \"error_code\":

the this line https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/blob/569b0ba2035819668528613494eb470cef4aec1f/app/actions/services/service_instance_delete.rb#L86 calls the broker and throws an

that there seems nothing to delete the operations.\r\n\r\nI suspect the DeleterLock https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/blob/569b0ba2035819668528613494eb470cef4aec1f/app/actions/services/service_instance_delete.rb#L81-L82\r\n\r\nto just save a new empty operations record in the table because it destroys it first\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/blob/569b0ba2035819668528613494eb470cef4aec1f/app/actions/services/locks/deleter_lock.rb#L15-L22\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/blob/569b0ba2035819668528613494eb470cef4aec1f/app/models/services/managed_service_instance.rb#L148-L153\r\n\r\nBut

Love this gem and have been using it on my rails app (AnkiAchievements.com) which is open source at github.com/jac241/spaced_rep_achievements . Unfortunately, I noticed an issue relating to thread safety and your middleware. Users were reporting becoming logged in as another user while using the app - i.e. the headers and responses for the two different requests were either being swapped or the first was being overwritten by the second. I looked back through the logs and saw that this would occur when two requests exactly overlapped. I use a common, threaded webserver (puma). \r\n\r\nI think setting `@status, @headers, @response = @app.call(env)` and then returning those instance variables makes the middleware not thread safe and could be the source of my problems. I am not a puma expert, but I think it only instantiates the middlewares once and then shares the single instances with each thread, so setting/updating an instance variable could overwrite one set by a different
