Eventually I'd like to update it to work with parameter validation, but for now it needs to stay that way.

Generate amber app from latest release\r\n1. `shards build amber`\r\n1. `bin/amber generate scaffold animal name:string cat:boolean`\r\n1. `bin/amber db migrate`\r\n1. `bin/amber watch`\r\n1.
