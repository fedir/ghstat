Removing a sibling **after** the input is okay.\r\n\r\nFor example, removing the `<span>` or one of the `<input>` in this mock dynamic form:\r\n```jsx\r\n<div>\r\n  { state.visible ? <span key={\"theSpan\"}>I might disappear</span> : null }\r\n  { state.inputs.map(inputName => (\r\n      <input\r\n          key={name}\r\n          oninput={ (event) => action.mightRemoveAnInputOrTheSpan(event.target.value)}\r\n      />\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn `element.insertBefore` call is being made for every keyed child beyond the removed one, which is likely when focus is lost.   In this case, it is also an unecessary perf hit, since a single `removeElement` operation could have been performed instead.\r\n```js\r\n          if (oldKey === newKey) {\r\n            patch(element, keyedNode[0], keyedNode[1], children[k], isSvg)\r\n            i++\r\n          } else if (keyedNode[0]) {\r\n            patch(\r\n              element,\r\n              element.insertBefore(keyedNode[0], oldElements[i]), // <--- THIS\r\n              keyedNode[1],\r\n              children[k],\r\n              isSvg\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\n@jorgebucaran Is this an issue that will be resolved with the diffing re-write you've talked about?

The problem is that when I am writing on the textboxes I experience too much lag until the characters are actually displayed on the input - also, if I write too fast some characters are actually missing ... For example if I write 123123123123123 really quick I'll get something like this in the input: 12312322112. The problem, of course is that propagating the state for every keyup is too expensive and, in react is solved with local state. How can this problem be solved in hyperapp? Is there a technique I don't know -- the form is really not usable. \r\n\r\nTIA","score":1.0}]}
