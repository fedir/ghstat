Removing a sibling **after** the input is okay.\r\n\r\nFor example, removing the `<span>` or one of the `<input>` in this mock dynamic form:\r\n```jsx\r\n<div>\r\n  { state.visible ? <span key={\"theSpan\"}>I might disappear</span> : null }\r\n  { state.inputs.map(inputName => (\r\n      <input\r\n          key={name}\r\n          oninput={ (event) => action.mightRemoveAnInputOrTheSpan(event.target.value)}\r\n      />\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn `element.insertBefore` call is being made for every keyed child beyond the removed one, which is likely when focus is lost.   In this case, it is also an unecessary perf hit, since a single `removeElement` operation could have been performed instead.\r\n```js\r\n          if (oldKey === newKey) {\r\n            patch(element, keyedNode[0], keyedNode[1], children[k], isSvg)\r\n            i++\r\n          } else if (keyedNode[0]) {\r\n            patch(\r\n              element,\r\n              element.insertBefore(keyedNode[0], oldElements[i]), // <--- THIS\r\n              keyedNode[1],\r\n              children[k],\r\n              isSvg\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\n@jorgebucaran Is this an issue that will be resolved with the diffing re-write you've talked about?

And it seems to work great with hyperapp, aside from one thing. On each hot-reload, it seems to re-add event handlers, causing them to eventually be double/triple/quad called from a single click.\r\n\r\nMy view is basically just the example code:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { h, View } from 'hyperapp'\r\nimport { state, State } from './state'\r\nimport { actions, Actions } from './actions'\r\n\r\nexport const view: View<State, Actions> = (state, actions) => (\r\n  <div>\r\n    <h1>{state.count}</h1>\r\n    <button onclick={() => actions.down(1)}>-</button>\r\n    <button onclick={() => actions.up(1)}>+</button>\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I change any source code file, I see the changes in my browser immediately, but then one click triggers the action as many times as hot reloads have happened.\r\n\r\nGiven that `addEventListener` appears exactly once in the whole framework, I'm guessing there is a bug here wher ethe previous event handers are not being cleared before new ones are installed: https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp/blob/master/src/index.js#L170","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/656","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/656/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/656/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/656/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/656","id":306962153,"number":656,"title":"How to get content for Component?","user":{"login":"van-nguyen","id":1149825,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1149825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-nguyen","html_url":"https://github.com/van-nguyen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-nguyen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-nguyen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-nguyen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-nguyen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-nguyen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-nguyen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-nguyen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-nguyen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-nguyen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":638682850,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/labels/QUESTION","name":"QUESTION","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-03-20T17:20:50Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T17:30:21Z","closed_at":"2018-03-20T17:29:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"How would I go about creating a `Button` component with text content in it?

The problem is that when I am writing on the textboxes I experience too much lag until the characters are actually displayed on the input - also, if I write too fast some characters are actually missing ... For example if I write 123123123123123 really quick I'll get something like this in the input: 12312322112. The problem, of course is that propagating the state for every keyup is too expensive and, in react is solved with local state. How can this problem be solved in hyperapp? Is there a technique I don't know -- the form is really not usable. \r\n\r\nTIA","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/593","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/593/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/593/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/593/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/593","id":296907217,"number":593,"title":"Feature: keeping <head>/<title> up-to-date","user":{"login":"dbkaplun","id":1765130,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1765130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun","html_url":"https://github.com/dbkaplun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":533252122,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/labels/COMMUNITY","name":"COMMUNITY","color":"0052cc","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-02-13T22:21:54Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T17:01:16Z","closed_at":"2018-02-15T12:19:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Would be great if I could use hyperapp or a hyperapp plugin to keep <head> up-to-date, a la [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).\r\n\r\nThanks for considering!","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/588","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/588/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/588/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/588/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/588","id":296285410,"number":588,"title":"Hyperapp do not call oncreate handler when view mounted to document.body","user":{"login":"jmas","id":90701,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/90701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmas","html_url":"https://github.com/jmas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-02-12T07:26:31Z","updated_at":"2018-02-15T12:58:46Z","closed_at":"2018-02-15T12:58:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Code:\r\n```js\r\nimport { h, app } from 'hyperapp';\r\n\r\nfunction view() {\r\n  return (<div oncreate={() => console.log('log oncreate')} />);\r\n}\r\n\r\napp({}, {}, view, document.body);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case we do not see a message `log oncreate`.

In React the component would simply track state.isExpanded and return either props.children or something else based on the value of it.
