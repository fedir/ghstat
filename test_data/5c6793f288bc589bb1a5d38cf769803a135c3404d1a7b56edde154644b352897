Cookiecutter supports full-blown jinja2 templating with conditional logic. This is much better than pcreate's stupid simple string replacement algorithm.\r\n2. There is a bootstrap issue with the scaffolds right now which is a little weird.\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. create virtualenv\r\n2. `pip install pyramid`\r\n3. `pcreate -s starter myapp`\r\n4. cd myapp\r\n5. create virtualenv\r\n6. `pip install -e .`\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's possible to re-use the original virtualenv but it can make the filesystem layout differently for someone cloning the repo versus someone creating a new project if you do. The goal should be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. create myapp starter\r\n2. cd myapp\r\n3. create virtualenv\r\n4. `pip install -e .`\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo now we always create a virtualenv from the same layout... a cloned or newly created project.\r\n\r\nThere is a big CON that maybe could be coordinated with the cookiecutter team. The hooks system is super simplistic in cookiecutter and does not seem to allow much runnable code. This means lots of logic we normally do in python would be put into the jinja2 templates.

I observed this behaviour only on `_default()` method. Here are steps to reproduce:\n\n``` python\nimport logging\nfrom wsgiref.simple_server import make_server\nfrom tg import expose, TGController, AppConfig, cached\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n\nclass RootController(TGController):\n    @cached(expire=100)\n    @expose()\n    def index(self, **kw):\n        return dict(status='works', **kw)\n\n    @cached(expire=100)\n    @expose()\n    def _default(self, id):\n        return dict(status='fails', id=id)\n\n\nconfig = AppConfig(minimal=True, root_controller=RootController())\nconfig['cache.enabled'] = True\nconfig['default_renderer'] = 'json'\n\nmake_server('', 8080, config.make_wsgi_app()).serve_forever()\n```\n\nLet's try some tests:\n\n```\n# 1st index get, data stored to cache\n$ curl http://localhost:8080/?id=1\n{\"status\": \"works\", \"id\": \"1\"}\n# 2nd index get with another parameter, data stored to cache\n$ curl http://localhost:8080/?id=2\n{\"status\": \"works\", \"id\": \"2\"}\n# 1st get on _default, for id=3\n$ curl http://localhost:8080/3\n{\"status\": \"fails\", \"id\": \"3\"}\n# 2nd get on _default with id=4, incorrectly returns cached value id=3\n$ curl http://localhost:8080/4\n{\"status\": \"fails\", \"id\": \"3\"}\n```\n\nI was not able to make `@cached` work using argument `key`.
