have an onyx grabber system on a toolbar with two buttons.

The buttons are also very responsive on these systems, never activating the pop-up function of the toolbar itself.\n\nOn an android device the buttons never animate, and pressing them will occasionally activate the popup function of the toolbar itself, as if the tap is bubbling incorrectly.\n\nThis is the construct of the sliding panel with the toolbar.

Its not clear where Enyo as a whole, its components, or its specific features and capabilities can be expected to work.\n\n**Justification:**\n- I believe developer and business adoption of Enyo will benefit from greater visibility into its compatibility with various HTML environments (i.e. Browsers, WebViews, AIR, etc.)\n- IMO, serious developers and businesses need more assurance than the [\"Enyo 2.0 now runs across mobile environments and desktop browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer\"](http://enyojs.com/) statement on the framework's site.\n\n**Proposal:**\n- Create one or more compatibility tables like Juriy Zaytsev's [ES5 Compatibility Table](http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/) for Enyo, its APIs and its Widgets.\n- Use [Browserscope](http://www.browserscope.org/user/tests/howto) to automate gathering compatibility information from a much larger audience than the framework's core team or

Input also supports the standard DOM event 'onchange', which fires only when an input loses focus (or in other cases?).\n\nAfaict, Checkbox doesn't ever fire 'onInputChange' and only supports 'onchange'.\n\nSuggest we add some docs to Input to describe the different events and which to use in what scenario. Possibly 'onInputChange' should be 'onRealtimeChange' or something, else I've misunderstood it's purpose. Also, Checkbox should probably fire 'onInputChange' along with 'change'.\n\nThe overall goal is for form-type inputs to have consistent API as much as possible (e.g. 'value').\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo/issues/60","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo/issues/60/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo/issues/60/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo/issues/60/events","html_url":"https://github.com/enyojs/enyo/issues/60","id":4338094,"number":60,"title":"Enyo2 lists do not scroll in the Pre3 web browser","user":{"login":"sidamos","id":873537,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/873537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidamos","html_url":"https://github.com/sidamos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidamos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidamos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidamos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidamos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidamos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidamos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidamos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidamos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidamos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6197322,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo/labels/Tier%202","name":"Tier 2","color":"0b02e1","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"germboy","id":371785,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/371785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy","html_url":"https://github.com/germboy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"germboy","id":371785,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/371785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy","html_url":"https://github.com/germboy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germboy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-04-28T23:13:15Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T18:30:43Z","closed_at":"2017-06-05T18:30:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The list example at http://enyojs.com/samples/list/ does not scroll in the Pre3 web browser.\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo/issues/59","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo/issues/59/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo/issues/59/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enyojs/enyo/issues/59/events","html_url":"https://github.com/enyojs/enyo/issues/59","id":4335349,"number":59,"title":"Style property on a kind ignored if trailing ;
