I am thinking to do something similar (or even simpler) with configuration, to make configs partially DI-driven and facilitate config reuse. The following code demonstrates use cases and the API to handle them:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nBQCoreModule.extend(binder)\r\n\r\n   // 1. Often 70-80% of the app config is stuff reusable between similar apps and all \r\n   // environments, so contributing a piece of unconditional config to the app via a DI module \r\n   // is a common use case. This config will be loaded before anything else.\r\n   // Should probably be skipped for help command, so that invalid configs don't prevent \r\n   // help from running.\r\n   .addConfig(\"classpath:default.yml\")\r\n\r\n   // 2. load config if a specified option is present. If the option itself results in \r\n   // contributing to the app configuration, then configuration provided in this method will be \r\n   // loaded before any configuration provided via the option.\r\n   // The difference between this method and  \"addConfigResourceOption\", is that the new \r\n   // method does not create a new option. It \"decorates\" an existing one. Also it is additive, \r\n   // and can be called for the same option multiple times.\r\n   .addConfigOnOption(\"production\", \"classpath:prod.yml\");\r\n```\r\nWith the above individual modules will be able to contribute configuration, both unconditional and option-driven. Organization-wide configs (potentially environment aware) will be possible by adding this or that module. \r\n\r\nWith this feature `addConfigResourceOption` seems obsolete.

issue for [Deprecating BQ_* vars](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bootique-user/tiMAVn8WjQ0) as the first step to get rid of BQ_* vars at all.\r\n\r\n@andrus : \"Wanted to mention that we are seriously thinking of deprecating and eventually getting rid of BQ_* vars with meaningful names used for configuration purposes. \r\n\r\nAs you may know, you can create var names based on config property paths (e.g. $BQ_JDBC_MYDB_PASSWORD is the same as \"jdbc.mydb.password\"), and Bootique will use the values as if they came from YAML or another config source. Sounded like a good idea at the time, but not anymore. From my own experience and watching a few dev teams, var name clashes between different apps are a cause of frequent WTF moments. People would declare these vars in ~/.bashrc for the purpose of one app and then forget it. A month later they'd be working on a new project and the new app starts throwing random Jackson errors, connecting to the wrong services, etc. I had other reasons to dislike the approach (names like \"BQ_JERSEYCLIENT_AUTH_XYZ_TOKENURL\" are not exactly readable), but name collisions and resulting confusion is the main one. \r\n\r\nOf course we are not going to take away the ability to configure Bootique via shell vars. That's an awesome feature and I love it. We just need to make it smarter. \"BQCoreModule.extend(..).declareVar(..)\" is a much safer replacement for BQ_* vars. It has the advantage of app-controlled naming (no need for a global naming convention, names can be contextual and descriptive). Also all declared vars show in the \"help\". Considering that most config should stay in YAML/JSON, you only need a few vars per app (e.g. things like passwords that should not go to SCM-controlled files). So the explicit approach scales quite well. I don't think I've ever had more than 5-6 vars per app (usually just 1-2). \r\n\r\nI migrated all my apps away from BQ_* some time ago, and never looked back. I feel that var naming convention approach goes against the \"no surprises\" philosophy of Bootique, and we are better off without it. \r\n\r\nThoughts, comments are welcome.
