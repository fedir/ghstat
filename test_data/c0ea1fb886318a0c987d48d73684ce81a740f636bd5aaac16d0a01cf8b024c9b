I am thinking to do something similar (or even simpler) with configuration, to make configs partially DI-driven and facilitate config reuse. The following code demonstrates use cases and the API to handle them:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nBQCoreModule.extend(binder)\r\n\r\n   // 1. Often 70-80% of the app config is stuff reusable between similar apps and all \r\n   // environments, so contributing a piece of unconditional config to the app via a DI module \r\n   // is a common use case. This config will be loaded before anything else.\r\n   // Should probably be skipped for help command, so that invalid configs don't prevent \r\n   // help from running.\r\n   .addConfig(\"classpath:default.yml\")\r\n\r\n   // 2. load config if a specified option is present. If the option itself results in \r\n   // contributing to the app configuration, then configuration provided in this method will be \r\n   // loaded before any configuration provided via the option.\r\n   // The difference between this method and  \"addConfigResourceOption\", is that the new \r\n   // method does not create a new option. It \"decorates\" an existing one. Also it is additive, \r\n   // and can be called for the same option multiple times.\r\n   .addConfigOnOption(\"production\", \"classpath:prod.yml\");\r\n```\r\nWith the above individual modules will be able to contribute configuration, both unconditional and option-driven. Organization-wide configs (potentially environment aware) will be possible by adding this or that module. \r\n\r\nWith this feature `addConfigResourceOption` seems obsolete. YAML configs can be activated on option via the new decoration API.\r\n\r\n_Note that an alternative to such assembly-time complex configuration would be a centralized bootstrap service that tells the app about its environment: `java -jar my.jar -c https://example.org/configs`_","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique/issues/197","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique/issues/197/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique/issues/197/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique/issues/197/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bootique/bootique/issues/197","id":275168732,"number":197,"title":"Commands starting background processes should unblock invoker threads","user":{"login":"andrus","id":42668,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/42668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus","html_url":"https://github.com/andrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique/milestones/18","html_url":"https://github.com/bootique/bootique/milestone/18","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bootique/bootique/milestones/18/labels","id":2832908,"number":18,"title":"0.25","description":null,"creator":{"login":"elena-bondareva","id":12942708,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12942708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elena-bondareva","html_url":"https://github.com/elena-bondareva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elena-bondareva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elena-bondareva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elena-bondareva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elena-bondareva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elena-bondareva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elena-bondareva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elena-bondareva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elena-bondareva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elena-bondareva/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":1,"closed_issues":13,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-10-12T12:36:31Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T13:57:38Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-11-19T15:45:54Z","updated_at":"2017-12-02T11:51:54Z","closed_at":"2017-12-02T11:51:50Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Currently commands like `--server` and `--scheduler` are implemented to start a background process and then block till the end of the app via `Thread.currentThread().join()`..

issue for [Deprecating BQ_* vars](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bootique-user/tiMAVn8WjQ0) as the first step to get rid of BQ_* vars at all.\r\n\r\n@andrus : \"Wanted to mention that we are seriously thinking of deprecating and eventually getting rid of BQ_* vars with meaningful names used for configuration purposes. \r\n\r\nAs you may know, you can create var names based on config property paths (e.g. $BQ_JDBC_MYDB_PASSWORD is the same as \"jdbc.mydb.password\"), and Bootique will use the values as if they came from YAML or another config source. Sounded like a good idea at the time, but not anymore. From my own experience and watching a few dev teams, var name clashes be
8000
tween different apps are a cause of frequent WTF moments. People would declare these vars in ~/.bashrc for the purpose of one app and then forget it. A month later they'd be working on a new project and the new app starts throwing random Jackson errors, connecting to the wrong services, etc. I had other reasons to dislike the approach (names like \"BQ_JERSEYCLIENT_AUTH_XYZ_TOKENURL\" are not exactly readable), but name collisions and resulting confusion is the main one. \r\n\r\nOf course we are not going to take away the ability to configure Bootique via shell vars. That's an awesome feature and I love it. We just need to make it smarter. \"BQCoreModule.extend(..).declareVar(..)\" is a much safer replacement for BQ_* vars. It has the advantage of app-controlled naming (no need for a global naming convention, names can be contextual and descriptive). Also all declared vars show in the \"help\". Considering that most config should stay in YAML/JSON, you only need a few vars per app (e.g. things like passwords that should not go to SCM-controlled files). So the explicit approach scales quite well. I don't think I've ever had more than 5-6 vars per app (usually just 1-2). \r\n\r\nI migrated all my apps away from BQ_* some time ago, and never looked back. I feel that var naming convention approach goes against the \"no surprises\" philosophy of Bootique, and we are better off without it. \r\n\r\nThoughts, comments are welcome.

requires more analysis and discussion. Our current \"single command per app\" design works great - it is easy to understand, command contributions work automatically, etc. However there are often questions from the field on how to do extra things in addition to the main command. A few scenarios:\r\n\r\n* I'd like to run Jetty, but also start job scheduler in the same app (so there are 2 **parallel commands** involved).\r\n* I'd like to run healthchecks before the main command can execute (so there are 2 **sequential commands**).\r\n\r\nAnd of course there can be other invocation trees of any complexity. Currently this task can be solved using custom commands that implement the right sequence with a thread pool and CompletableFutures. \r\n\r\nWondering if we can generalize it though? It may be useful in situations when e.g. you want to run healthchecks and when those pass, start Jetty, all by just combining a bunch of modules, without the need to deal with completable futures.\r\n\r\nAlso note that command invocation tree is very similar to **job groups** recently introduced in `bootique-job`, where we have a YAML DSL for defining job execution tree. Perhaps commands and jobs are the same thing after all?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWe ended up with a solution that allows to decorate any given command with \"before\" and \"also\" commands that are triggered when the command in question is run:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCommandDecorator decorator = CommandDecorator\r\n      .beforeRun(ExtraCommand.class, \"--f1\", \"--f2\");\r\nBQCoreModule.extend(binder).decorateCommand(MyCommand.class, decorator);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTODO: \r\n\r\n* allow for true background commands that do not block the execution thread.
