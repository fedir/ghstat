Then I wanted to add asp.net core healthchecks (https://github.com/Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks) with datbase storage providers and entity framework health checks.\r\n\r\nSince the healthchecks use efcore 3.1.1 I get an assembly mismatch error in the form of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.AggregateException : One or more errors occurred. (Unable to load one or more of the requested types.\r\nCould not load type 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.RelationalModelAnnotations' from assembly 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational, Version=3.1.6.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=adb9793829ddae60'.\r\nCould not load type 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.RelationalPropertyAnnotations' from assembly 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational, Version=3.1.6.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=adb9793829ddae60'.\r\nCould not load type 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Internal.RelationalFullAnnotationNames' from assembly 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational, Version=3.1.6.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=adb9793829ddae60'.) (The following constructor parameters did not have matching fixture data: AppHostFixture appHostFixture)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd binding redirects are not available on .net core. So, how do I handle this scenario?\r\nHow can I tell dotnet to just use the latest version?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Replies\r\n\r\nFrom @smitpatel\r\n\r\n.NET Core combines them without needing binding redirect. EF Core 3.1.1 will get lifted to 3.1.6. The error is not saying about incorrect version. It is showing that assembly got lifted.\r\n\r\nLooking at specific type names in the error - RelationalModelAnnotations was present in 2.x releases and it was removed in 3.0 release which indicates that you are trying to use some package which depends on EF Core 2.x and after the lift it cannot actually work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFrom @ErikEJ\r\n\r\nPlease share your csproj file\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFrom @andrejohansson\r\n\r\nI resolved it, but actually the error was triggered by a bit of reflection code on my end which iterated all types in all loaded assemblies (bad move). I just filtered out to iterate my own types and then I did not trigger the assembly load that caused the exception.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SwiftRex/SwiftRex/issues/88","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SwiftRex/SwiftRex","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SwiftRex/SwiftRex/issues/88/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SwiftRex/SwiftRex/issues/88/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SwiftRex/SwiftRex/issues/88/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SwiftRex/SwiftRex/issues/88","id":728713011,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3Mjg3MTMwMTE=","number":88,"title":"Dynamic store","user":{"login":"VasilyKrainov","id":31650157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjUwMTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31650157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VasilyKrainov","html_url":"https://github.com/VasilyKrainov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VasilyKrainov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VasilyKrainov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VasilyKrainov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VasilyKrainov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VasilyKrainov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VasilyKrainov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VasilyKrainov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VasilyKrainov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VasilyKrainov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2020-10-24T07:06:23Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T18:52:12Z","closed_at":"2020-10-27T15:38:40Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Suppose I have 2 modules: MainModule and FormModule, where FormModule creation is initiated by some user action.

These changes impact remote authentication scenarios like OpenIdConnect and WsFederation which must now opt out by sending SameSite=None. However, SameSite=None breaks on iOS 12 and some older versions of other browsers. The application will need to sniff these versions and omit SameSite.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n3.1.0-preview1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nSameSite is a [2016 draft standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07#section-4.1) extension to HTTP cookies intended to mitigate cross site request forgery (CSRF). This was originally designed as a feature the servers would opt into by adding the new parameters. ASP.NET Core 2.0 added initial support for SameSite.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nGoogle is now pushing [a new draft standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00) that is not backwards compatible. It changes the default mode to Lax and adds a new entry None to opt out. Lax is OK for most application cookies but breaks cross site scenarios like OpenIdConnect and WsFederation login. Most OAuth logins are not affected due to differences in how the request flows. The new None parameter causes compatibility problems with clients that implemented the prior draft standard (e.g. iOS 12). Chrome plans to go live with their changes in Chrome 80 in February 2020.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 3.1 has been [updated](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/13776/files) to implement the new SameSite behavior. This includes redefining the behavior of SameSiteMode.None to emit “SameSite=None” and adding a new value SameSiteMode.Unspecified to omit the SameSite attribute. All cookies APIs now default to Unspecified, though some components that use cookies set values more specific to their scenarios such as the OpenIdConnect correlation and nonce cookies.\r\n\r\nFor other recent changes in this area see the [3.0 announcement](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/348) where most defaults were changed from Lax to None (but still using the prior standard).\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nBrowser and spec changes as outlined above.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplications that interact with remote sites such as through 3rd party login will need to test those scenarios on multiple browsers, as well as apply the CookiePolicy browser sniffing mitigation discussed below. See below for testing and browser sniffing instructions.\r\nHow to test if you’re affected \r\nTest your web application using a client version that can opt-in to the new behavior. Chrome, Firefox, and Chromium Edge all have new opt-in feature flags that can be used for testing. \r\nYou’ll also want to do compatibility testing with older client versions after you’ve applied the patches, especially Safari. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\n \r\nChrome:\r\nChrome 78+ will give you misleading test results as it has a temporary mitigation in place, allowing cookies less than two minutes old. Chrome 76 or 77 with the appropriate test flags turned on will give you more accurate results. To test the new behavior toggle chrome://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies to enabled. Older versions of Chrome (75 and below) are reported to fail with the new None setting. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\nWhilst Google does not make older chrome versions available you can download older versions of Chromium which will suffice for testing. Follow the instructions at https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium, don’t go downloading random assed installers from the internet that say they’re for older versions.  \r\n[Chromium 76 Win64 ](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Win_x64/664998/)\r\n[Chromium 74 Win64](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Win_x64/638880/)\r\n\r\nSafari:\r\nSafari 12 strictly implemented the prior draft and will fail if it sees the new None value in cookies. This must be avoided via the browser sniffing code shown below. Ensure you test Safari 12 and Safari 13 as well as WebKit based OS style logins using MSAL, ADAL or whatever library you are using. Note that the problem is dependent on the underlying OS version, OSX Mojave (10.14) and iOS 12 are known to have compatibility problems with the new behavior. Upgrading the OS to OSX Catalina (10.15) or iOS 13 fixes the problem. Safari does not currently have an opt-in flag for testing the new spec behavior. \r\n\r\nFirefox:\r\nFirefox support for the new standard can be tested on version 68+ by opting in on the “about:config” page with the feature flag “network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault”. There have not been reports of compatibility issues with older versions of Firefox. \r\n\r\nEdge:\r\nWhile Edge supports the old SameSite standard, as of version 44 it did not have any compatibility problems with the new standard. \r\n\r\nEdge (Chromium):\r\nThe feature flag is edge://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies. No compatibility issues were observed when testing with Edge Chromium 78. \r\n\r\nElectron:\r\nVersions of electron will include older versions of Chromium, for example the version of Electron used by Teams is Chromium 66 which exhibits the older behavior. You must perform your own compatibility testing with the version of Electron your product uses. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\n\r\nSupporting older browsers:\r\nThe 2016 SameSite standard mandated that unknown values must be treated as SameSite=Strict values, so any older browsers which support the original standard may break when they see a SameSite property with a value of None. Web applications must implement browser sniffing if they intend to support these old browsers. AspNetCore as a rule does not implement browser sniffing for you because User-Agents values are highly unstable and change on a weekly basis. What is available is an extension point in CookiePolicy allowing you to plug in User-Agent specific logic. \r\n\r\nIn Startup.cs add the following\r\n``` csharp\r\nprivate void CheckSameSite(HttpContext httpContext, CookieOptions options) \r\n{ \r\n    if (options.SameSite == SameSiteMode.None) \r\n    { \r\n        var userAgent = httpContext.Request.Headers[\"User-Agent\"].ToString(); \r\n        // TODO: Use your User Agent library of choice here. \r\n        if (/* UserAgent doesn’t support new behavior */) \r\n        { \r\n               options.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Unspecified; \r\n        } \r\n    } \r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) \r\n{ \r\n    services.Configure<CookiePolicyOptions>(options => \r\n    { \r\n        options.MinimumSameSitePolicy = SameSiteMode.Unspecified; \r\n        options.OnAppendCookie = cookieContext =>  \r\n            CheckSameSite(cookieContext.Context, cookieContext.CookieOptions); \r\n        options.OnDeleteCookie = cookieContext =>  \r\n            CheckSameSite(cookieContext.Context, cookieContext.CookieOptions); \r\n    }); \r\n} \r\n \r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app) \r\n{ \r\n    app.UseCookiePolicy(); // Before UseAuthentication or anything else that writes cookies. \r\n    app.UseAuthentication(); \r\n    // … \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpt-out switches:\r\nThere is a compat switch which enables you to temporarily opt-out of the new ASP.NET Core cookie behavior. Add a runtimeconfig.template.json file to your project containing: \r\n``` jsonc\r\n{ \r\n  \"configProperties\": { \r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SuppressSameSiteNone\": \"true\" \r\n  } \r\n} \r\n```\r\nThis switch will be removed in the next major version.\r\n\r\nOther Versions:\r\nRelated SameSite patches are forthcoming for ASP.NET Core 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, Microsoft.Owin 4.1, and System.Web (.NET 4.7.2+).\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[SameSiteMode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.samesitemode)\r\n[CookieOptions.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.cookieoptions.samesite)\r\n[CookieBuilder.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.cookiebuilder.samesite)\r\n[CookiePolicyOptions.MinimumSameSitePolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.cookiepolicyoptions.minimumsamesitepolicy) \r\n\r\nMicrosoft.Net.Http.Headers:\r\n[SameSiteMode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.net.http.headers.samesitemode)\r\n[SetCookieHeaderValue.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.net.http.headers.setcookieheadervalue.samesite)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bafolts/terraforming-mars/issues/1661","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bafolts/terraforming-mars","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bafolts/terraforming-mars/issues/1661/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bafolts/terraforming-mars/issues/1661/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bafolts/terraforming-mars/issues/1661/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bafolts/terraforming-mars/issues/1661","id":724116718,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MjQxMTY3MTg=","number":1661,"title":"Time to leave Vue.js?","user":{"login":"bafolts","id":2707843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDc4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2707843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bafolts","html_url":"https://github.com/bafolts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bafolts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bafolts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bafolts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bafolts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bafolts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bafolts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bafolts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bafolts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bafolts/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":856134053,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTYxMzQwNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bafolts/terraforming-mars/labels/question","name":"question","color":"d876e3","default":true,"description":"Further information is requested"},{"id":856134052,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTYxMzQwNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bafolts/terraforming-mars/labels/rfc","name":"rfc","color":"e4e669","default":false,"description":"Request for comments on draft / POC"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":23,"created_at":"2020-10-18T20:45:04Z","updated_at":"2020-10-20T19:27:01Z","closed_at":"2020-10-20T15:28:17Z","author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I think we have overstayed our welcome with Vue.js.

For example [NotificationService](https://github.com/crc-32/libpebblecommon/blob/de5635a17dfe2e54c2ba8a436f261c6007a4ac79/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/rebble/libpebblecommon/services/notification/NotificationService.kt) currently has dependency on `BlobDBService`, which is currently an object:\r\n\r\n```\r\nobject NotificationService {\r\n\r\n    fun send() {\r\n        BlobDBService.send(...)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf we switch to dependency injection, we provide BlobDbService via constructor:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass NotificationService(private val blobDbService: BlobDBService) {\r\n\r\n    fun send() {\r\n        blobDbService.send(...)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has mainly two advantages:\r\n\r\n* If BlobDBService is no longer object and we move all its initialization to its constructor, we can guarantee that BlobDBService is completely initialized when provided (currently there is no compile time guarantee that `BlobDBService.init()` would be called before it is used. If someone forgets to initialize it, whole app can crash without previous warning)\r\n* If/when we decide to add unit tests, it is trivial to replace this Blob db service with fake test version\r\n\r\nNow, manual dependency injection is quite a lot of work and boilerplate (you have to write a lot of code that just passes around objects to constructors). That is why this is usually done with a framework that does most of the heavy lifting for you. Most known frameworks for Kotlin are:\r\n\r\n* [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/) - It is de facto standard one. Very fast (most of the work is done at compile time) and pretty powerful, but it is the the most complicated one (however, once it clicks, it is very nice to use). This is the only one from the bunch I have any real experience with.\r\n* [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Variant of Dagger made by Google's Android team that simplifies a bunch of things and adds better support for Android stuff like Activities and Service. One downside of this is that it is still in Alpha.\r\n* [Kodein](https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/)\r\n* [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/36","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/ProjectReunion","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/36/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/36/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/36/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/36","id":621824218,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MjE4MjQyMTg=","number":36,"title":"Question: How does MAUI fit here?","user":{"login":"tesar-tech","id":33880579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODgwNTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/33880579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tesar-tech","html_url":"https://github.com/tesar-tech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tesar-tech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tesar-tech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tesar-tech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tesar-tech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tesar-tech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tesar-tech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tesar-tech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tesar-tech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tesar-tech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2170255504,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcwMjU1NTA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/ProjectReunion/labels/area-Other%20frameworks","name":"area-Other frameworks","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1989139032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg5MTM5MDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/ProjectReunion/labels/question","name":"question","color":"c8ffaf","default":true,"description":"Further information is requested"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"stevewri","id":65729571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzI5NTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/65729571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri","html_url":"https://github.com/stevewri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"stevewri","id":65729571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzI5NTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/65729571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri","html_url":"https://github.com/stevewri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevewri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2020-05-20T14:48:54Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T19:10:43Z","closed_at":"2020-11-02T19:10:43Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"This project is basically reunion of UWP and WPF => One best option for creating windows apps with capabilities from both technologies.

Although this is quite subjective, I find it hard to believe that a user would write the HTTP protocol manually like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet time = (new Date()).toUTCString()\r\nlet rHTML = `HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\nServer: j\\r\\nDate: ${time}\\r\\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\\r\\nContent-Length: `\r\nlet rTEXT = `HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\nServer: j\\r\\nDate: ${time}\\r\\nContent-Type:

parsing and use the socket directly.\r\n\r\nMore things that quickly jump out to the eyes are for example the `updates` test, where the update statement is hardcoded for the benchmark run, although it is stated that the number of queries is a variable between 1 and 500 I wouldn't call it production code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  sock.updateWorldById20 = await compile(sock, {\r\n    formats: [{ format: 1,

That is, it should not hold a reference to a ViewModel. Basically the `import` statements should be limited to SwiftUI.\r\n\r\nInstead it should have a few `let` (constant) values, like the title of the cell, the image for the toggle button and a closure to indicate the button has been tapped. That View can easily be designed and previewed without any deeper knowledge of the ViewModel or the Store.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport SwiftUI\r\n\r\nstruct ToggleCellView: View {\r\n    \r\n    let title: String\r\n    let imageName: String\r\n    let toggle: () -> Void\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        HStack {\r\n            Image(systemName: imageName)\r\n                .resizable()\r\n                .frame(width: 20, height: 20)\r\n                .onTapGesture(perform: toggle)\r\n            Text(title)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat would then be missing is to link the injected values to the ViewModel higher up, in the *Container* View. How would you go about creating this linking ?\r\n\r\nFor references, here are some of the posts that somewhat talk about this approach, while at the same time not being close enough yet to the stricter model mentioned above in SwiftRex : \r\n* https://swiftwithmajid.com/2019/07/31/introducing-container-views-in-swiftui/\r\n* https://swiftwithmajid.com/2019/09/18/redux-like-state-container-in-swiftui/\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rhboot/shim-review/issues/102","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rhboot/shim-review","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rhboot/shim-review/issues/102/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rhboot/shim-review/issues/102/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rhboot/shim-review/issues/102/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/issues/102","id":675135571,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NzUxMzU1NzE=","number":102,"title":"Shim-15.1 for Miray Software AG","user":{"login":"miray-tf","id":31439423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDM5NDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/31439423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miray-tf","html_url":"https://github.com/miray-tf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miray-tf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miray-tf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miray-tf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miray-tf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miray-tf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miray-tf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miray-tf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miray-tf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miray-tf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":770506848,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NzA1MDY4NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rhboot/shim-review/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2020-08-07T16:33:19Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T16:27:58Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T16:25:26Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Make sure you have provided the following information:\r\n\r\n -

Access to the token is restricted.\r\n\r\n###### Do you use EV certificates as embedded certificates in the SHIM?\r\n\r\nYes, EV certificate issued by DigiCert.\r\n\r\n###### If you use new vendor_db functionality, are any hashes whitelisted, and if yes: for what binaries ?\r\n\r\nNot used, no binaries whitelisted\r\n\r\n###### Is kernel upstream commit 75b0cea7bf307f362057cc778efe89af4c615354 present in your kernel, if you boot chain includes a linux kernel ?\r\n\r\nYes, we currently use linux lts kernel 5.4.51:\r\n75b0cea7bf307f362057cc778efe89af4c615354 was merged to upstream linux version 5.4.50\r\n\r\n###### if SHIM is loading grub2 bootloader, is CVE CVE-2020-10713 fixed ?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nGrub is branched from GRUB upstream commit e7b8856f8be3292afdb38d2e8c70ad8d62a61e10:\r\n'linux: Fix integer overflows in initrd size handling'\r\n\r\n##### Did you change your certificate strategy, so that affected by CVE CVE-2020-10713 grub2 bootloaders can not be verified ?\r\n\r\nNew shim uses new certificate.\r\nNo affected versions were signed with the new certificate.\r\n\r\n###### What is the origin and full version number of your bootloader (GRUB or other)?\r\n\r\nBootloader based on GRUB 2.04+e7b8856f8be3292afdb38d2e8c70ad8d62a61e10\r\nThat commit is currently the upstream HEAD and includes the BootHole patches\r\n\r\nThe GRUB tree is available from\r\nhttps://github.com/MiraySoftware/grub2/tree/sysload_2_5\r\n\r\n###### If your SHIM launches any other components, please provide further details on what is launched\r\n\r\nShim is only used to launch a GRUB 2.04 based bootloader.\r\n\r\n###### How do the launched components prevent execution of unauthenticated code?\r\n\r\nLoaded code is validated through shim.\r\nLinux is validated through linuxefi from fedora-33 branch of rhboot.\r\nSymobi kernel is validated through shim_lock module in GRUB.\r\nNo other code is loaded.\r\n\r\n###### Does your SHIM load any loaders that support loading unsigned kernels (e.g. GRUB)?\r\n\r\nNo, our GRUB flavor does not load any unsigned kernels when SecureBoot mode is active\r\nWe use a modified GRUB based on current trunk with shim_lock verifier module.\r\nGRUB includes the upstream BootHole patches\r\n\r\n###### What kernel are you using? Which patches does it includes to enforce Secure Boot?\r\n\r\n* Linux: Version 5.4.51 with additional lockdown patches from Debian. Automatic lockdown if booted in SecureBoot\r\n  Applied patches are\r\n    features/all/lockdown/efi-add-an-efi_secure_boot-flag-to-indicate-secure-b.patch\r\n

Previously I was iterating with `ion-item-sliding` for my child elements and everything worked fine.  I refactored my code so that the `ion-item-sliding` and all descendant nodes are part of a new component `cg-layer-select-item`. \r\n\r\nWhen I click and drag the `ion-reorder` component, I do not see my custom element \"lift\" itself out of the collection and begin the reordering process. If I drag my finger and *try* to move the item anyway, it tends to end up at the end of my `ion-reorder-group`, with the reorder event `detail` looking like ` { from: 1, to: 10 } ` where `10` is the last slot in the group.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n<!-- Describe what the behavior would be without the bug. -->\r\n\r\nI expect to be able to reliably reorder custom components with full animation support. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n<!--  Please explain the steps required to duplicate the issue, especially if you are able to provide a sample application. -->\r\n\r\nSample app: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ionic-v4-angular-tabs-a5ezqv\r\n\r\nNote there are TWO `ion-list`s with a direct child `ion-reorder-group`. The difference between the two is that one uses `ion-item` as a child, the other a custom component. The `ion-item` version works fine, but the custom component version does not. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Ionic info:**\r\n<!-- (run `ionic info` from a terminal/cmd prompt and paste output below): -->\r\n\r\n```\r\nIonic:\r\n\r\n   ionic (Ionic CLI)             : 4.12.0\r\n   Ionic Framework               : @ionic/angular 4.9.1\r\n   @angular-devkit/build-angular : 0.13.6\r\n   @angular-devkit/schematics    : 7.3.6\r\n   @angular/cli                  : 7.3.6\r\n   @ionic/angular-toolkit        : 1.4.0\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspnetcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806","id":580165912,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1ODAxNjU5MTI=","number":19806,"title":"[Discussion] Migrating dotnet/extensions content to dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore","user":{"login":"anurse","id":7574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anurse","html_url":"https://github.com/anurse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anurse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anurse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anurse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anurse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anurse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anurse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anurse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anurse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anurse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspnetcore/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspnetcore/milestones/1/labels","id":1533813,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTUzMzgxMw==","number":1,"title":"Discussions","description":null,"creator":{"login":"Eilon","id":202643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjY0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/202643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eilon","html_url":"https://github.com/Eilon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eilon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eilon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eilon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eilon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eilon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eilon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eilon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eilon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eilon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":152,"closed_issues":1206,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-01-22T07:04:21Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T20:00:54Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":16,"created_at":"2020-03-12T19:19:40Z","updated_at":"2020-11-12T02:04:23Z","closed_at":"2020-11-12T02:04:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"*This is the discussion thread for https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/411*\r\n\r\nAs part of the [ongoing repository consolidation effort](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119) in .NET 5, we are working to move most of the content from dotnet/extensions into other repositories. Most of these packages were developed by and are currently maintained by the ASP.NET team. However, moving forward we want to enable more scenarios with these packages, outside of ASP.NET.\r\n\r\nThe packages which we believe are usable in various application models (Configuration, DI, Hosting, etc.) are being moved to the **dotnet/runtime repository**. Packages which are primarily used in ASP.NET Core applications (Web Encoders, etc.) are moving to the **dotnet/aspnetcore repository**. Finally, in order to avoid introducing third-party dependencies into dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore, some packages are remaining in the **dotnet/extensions repository** as they have dependencies on third-party packages (such as integrations with StackExchange.Redis and other components).\r\n\r\nThe full list of packages that are moving can be found at the end of this announcement. In general, tests and samples will be moving to the relevant repo based on where the main package moved. Issue tracking for the relevant packages will also move to that repository.\r\n\r\n## PR/Issue migrations\r\n\r\nThere are 400+ open issues and ~50 open PRs (at time of writing) in dotnet/extensions.\r\n\r\nSince we are actively working on migrating the packages now, we recommend waiting to open new PRs until we update this announcement indicating the migration is complete. Some packages are building in two repositories and we want to make sure your changes land in the right place. Over the migration process, we'll be closing most of the active PRs that target packages which have been moved and asking the author to migrate the PR to the relevant repository.\r\n\r\nFor issues, feel free to continue opening them and we'll respond to them as best we can during the migration. If the package your issue relates to has been moved, we'll handle transferring the issue. We'll be doing some triaging of the incoming issues and the backlog and will attempt to migrate as many issues as possible. As part of this process, we'll also close issues that are no longer relevant, duplicates of other issues, or enhancements we don't plan to support.\r\n\r\n## Q&A\r\n\r\nIf your question isn't answered here, comment below to ask it!\r\n\r\n#### Are these packages moving in to the Base Class Library (\"BCL\"), or Microsoft.NETCore.App?**\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to change how these components ship as part of this migration. Packages that currently ship on NuGet.org will continue to do so. Libraries that are currently included in ASP.NET Core will continue to be included. We are not adding any of these components to the BCL at this time.\r\n\r\n#### If package `Microsoft.Extensions.X` is moving to the runtime repo, why not rename it to `System.X`?\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to rename assemblies and redirect type references, it is **not** possible to change package identities, namespaces or type names in a non-breaking way. Renaming these types would be extremely disruptive and provide very little benefit. All of these components are *already* covered by the [.NET Core Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) and will continue to be in the future, just like the `System.*` assemblies.\r\n\r\n#### Will these packages still support .NET Standard 2.0?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to reduce the set of frameworks these packages can be used on as part of this migration. If they currently support .NET Standard, we have no plans to change that.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why are some packages staying in dotnet/extension?\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, we want to avoid third-party dependencies in the dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore repositories. The packages that depend on third-party dependencies are remaining in dotnet/extensions to help preserve this.\r\n\r\n#### Where should I file issues related to these packages?\r\n\r\nIn general, file issues in the repo that contains the package. Some feature areas are split between multiple repos. If you're not sure, feel free to file issues in any of the three repos (dotnet/runtime, dotnet/extensions or dotnet/aspnetcore) and the team can transfer the issue as needed.\r\n\r\n#### Why did you move package `X` to repo `Y`?\r\n\r\nFeel free to **comment below** to ask questions about specific packages.\r\n\r\n## Package List\r\n\r\nThe following list identifies all the packages we currently ship from [dotnet/extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions) and which repo they are moving to.\r\n\r\n* Moving to [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)\r\n    * **Caching**\r\n
