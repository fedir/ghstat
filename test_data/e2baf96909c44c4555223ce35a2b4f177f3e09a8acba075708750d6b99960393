Unless you want to ensure that a user can always rebuild an application with a modified version of onion, it would be convenient to allow static linking as an exception (for people embedding onion statically without modifying it).\n\nI don't have examples of static linking exception for LGPLv3 but there exists some examples for LGPLv2. There is [Ogre](http://www.ogre3d.org/2009/03/06/lgpl-exclusions-added-static-linking-now-simpler) (but they switched to a more liberal license later), [WxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/about/newlicen.htm), [0mq](http://zeromq.org/area:licensing). I cannot say for which reasons the exception was added but I believe this is because of \"legit\" uses of static linking: easier embedding, platforms where dynamic linking is not available (like iOS), platforms lacking descent package management, easier version management.\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoreno/onion/issues/47","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoreno/onion","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoreno/onion/issues/47/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoreno/onion/issues/47/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoreno/onion/issues/47/events","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion/issues/47","id":24816422,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNDgxNjQyMg==","number":47,"title":"sendfile doesn't work properly with network disks","user":{"login":"vguzmanp","id":1254383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQzODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1254383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vguzmanp","html_url":"https://github.com/vguzmanp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vguzmanp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vguzmanp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vguzmanp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vguzmanp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vguzmanp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vguzmanp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vguzmanp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vguzmanp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vguzmanp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-12-27T11:06:39Z","updated_at":"2014-01-02T08:46:18Z","closed_at":"2014-01-02T08:46:18Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"My system is Ubuntu 12.04, kernel 3.5.0-37-generic #58~precise1-Ubuntu. \nMy system is inside a VirtualBox virtual machine, with a shared folder to the host system.
