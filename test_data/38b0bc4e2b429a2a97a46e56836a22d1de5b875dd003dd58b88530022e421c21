The package we are failing to install is https://github.com/luvit/luv. Here's the issue open on our end: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/79870 However, if from `luarocks`' repo, in `master` I run `luarocks --tree=test-luv install luv` the build doesn't fail, yet the warning message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: unmatched variable LUA_LIBDIR\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd also Cmake reports this variable as empty:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- Lua: using information from luarocks\r\n-- LUA_LIBDIR:\r\n-- LUA_INCDIR: /nix/store/9d6mlidaj99j673j583dgwlbj2b7yhnq-luajit-2.1.0-beta3/include\r\n-- LUA: /nix/store/9d6mlidaj99j673j583dgwlbj2b7yhnq-luajit-2.1.0-beta3/bin/luajit\r\n-- Lua library: LUA_LIBRARIES-NOTFOUND\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's likely that we'll need to update _something_ in our build infrastructure, so I'm trying to figure out what it is and the meaning of this warning. Help will be appreciated.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luvit/luvit/issues/1015","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luvit/luvit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luvit/luvit/issues/1015/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luvit/luvit/issues/1015/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luvit/luvit/issues/1015/events","html_url":"https://github.com/luvit/luvit/issues/1015","id":272815785,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzI4MTU3ODU=","number":1015,"title":"Lit Package search not working","user":{"login":"renatosc","id":6549539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDk1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6549539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatosc","html_url":"https://github.com/renatosc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatosc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatosc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatosc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatosc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatosc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatosc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatosc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatosc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatosc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1632131220,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjMyMTMxMjIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luvit/luvit/labels/lit","name":"lit","color":"92ef86","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2017-11-10T04:22:05Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T08:57:35Z","closed_at":"2020-03-11T08:57:35Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"https://luvit.io/lit.html\r\n\r\nIt appears to be CORS issue...\r\n\r\nFailed to load https://lit.luvit.io/search/*: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
