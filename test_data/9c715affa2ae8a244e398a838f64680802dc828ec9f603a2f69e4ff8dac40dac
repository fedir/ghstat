\r\nFollowed your instructions from March 2018 regarding multiple business routes and api tool usage via extension of Jooby class. Everything works withhin the App class (the routes per se as well as swagger listing). For the other modules (build as extension of Jooby, not as Jooby module) the routes only work partially. \r\n\r\nFor debugging reasons I implemented the following test code in my App.java: \r\n```\r\nget(\"/routetest\", (req, rsp) -> {\r\n\t\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\t\tApiParser parsertest = new ApiParser(dir());\r\n\t\t\t\tList<RouteMethod> routelist;\r\n\t\t\t\troutelist = parsertest.parseFully(new App());\r\n\t\t\t\t// rsp.send(Results.json(routelist));\r\n\t\t\t\tlog.info(\"routelist={}\", routelist);\r\n\t\t\t\trsp.send(\"ok routelist=\" + routelist.toString());\r\n\t\t\t} catch (Exception e) {\r\n\t\t\t\t// TODO Auto-generated catch block\r\n\t\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\r\n\t\t\t\trsp.send(\"error\");\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn App.java i implemented the following relevant code\r\n```\r\nuse(new ApiTool().swagger(\"/swagger\").raml(\"/raml\"));\r\nuse(new FileAccessModule());\r\nuse(new WebDavModule());\r\nuse(new PersistenceModule());                   \r\nuse(new AssetsModule());\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn every Module I implemented a route like that\r\n```\r\n\tpath(webname, ()  -> {\r\n\t\t\t/**\r\n\t\t\t   * \r\n\t\t\t   * List pets ordered by name.\r\n\t\t\t   * \r\n\t\t\t   * @param start Start offset, useful for paging. Default is ```0```.\r\n\t\t\t   * @param max Max page size, useful for paging.

noticed that the Metrics module would report all responses as status 200 for deferred methods. It appears that this happens because `InstrumentedHandler` puts the meter in a _finally_ block, and `ResponseImpl` throws a `DeferredExecution` exception as a way to handle responses. This results in the _finally_ block being executed before the response has a status set, and it just defaults to 200.\r\n\r\nI came up with this alternative implementation for the `InstrumentedHandler` (inspired by the `RequestLogger`) that seems to work.
