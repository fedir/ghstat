And when running cross domain, e.g. from localhost with two different ports, both Chrome and Firefox rejects the connections, because:\r\n\r\n`/api/subscribe: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:1337' is therefore not allowed access.`\r\n\r\nThe culprit seems to be org.jooby.internal.netty.NettySse#handshake, which has the current implementation:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Override\r\n  protected void handshake(final Runnable handler) throws Exception {\r\n    DefaultHttpHeaders headers = new DefaultHttpHeaders();\r\n    headers.set(HttpHeaderNames.CONNECTION, \"Close\");\r\n    headers.set(HttpHeaderNames.CONTENT_TYPE, \"text/event-stream; charset=utf-8\");\r\n    ctx.writeAndFlush(\r\n      new DefaultHttpResponse(HttpVersion.HTTP_1_1, HttpResponseStatus.OK, headers));\r\n    ctx.executor().execute(handler);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo obviously it totally disregards CORS, even though we've set:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse(\"*\", CorsHandler(Cors()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe tried to change it to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Override\r\n  protected void handshake(final Runnable handler) throws Exception {\r\n    DefaultHttpHeaders headers = new DefaultHttpHeaders();\r\n    headers.set(HttpHeaderNames.CONNECTION, \"keep-alive\");\r\n    headers.set(HttpHeaderNames.CONTENT_TYPE, \"text/event-stream; charset=utf-8\");\r\n\r\n    headers.set(\"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\", true);\r\n    headers.set(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"http://localhost:1337\");\r\n\r\n    ctx.writeAndFlush(\r\n      new DefaultHttpResponse(HttpVersion.HTTP_1_1, HttpResponseStatus.OK, headers));\r\n    ctx.executor().execute(handler);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now it works fine. Obviously hardcoded to our needs, and should be generalized, but I hope it illustrates the problem. jknack has said that this works in Jetty and Undertow, so probably a good idea to see what the differences are.\r\n\r\nI am not sure the `close` -> `keep-alive` change is necessary, both seem to work in Firefox and Chrome.

While migrating my app I noticed that the new module favors objects over classes when configuring clients, making it seemingly impossible to use dependency injection for `Authenticator` objects. \r\n\r\nOne such example is configuring a form client. [In the old module](https://github.com/yholkamp/jooby/blob/4718e4c33219114a8536406d8b61d82d97240190/modules/jooby-pac4j/src/main/java/org/jooby/pac4j/Auth.java#L586-L587) you could pass `DbProfileService.class` as argument, while [in the new module](https://github.com/yholkamp/jooby/blob/79899455ba048be8300e4455322b497513c34fd4/modules/jooby-pac4j2/src/main/java/org/jooby/pac4j/Pac4j.java#L557-L583) you can provide a `Authorizer` class and a function that creates a `Client` instance. As the function only receives a `Config` object, there is no way to access the Guice injector. Due to this it's seemingly impossible to use dependency injection to build a `FormClient` with a `DbProfileService`, as the latter would require a `DataSource` instance to be injected.\r\n\r\nI might be missing workaround to still achieve this with the new module but at first glance this makes it complicated to upgrade to the new module when using a database as profile

uses the NpmRunner instead of YarnRunner.\r\nOriginal:\r\n```\r\n    NpmRunner npm = factory.getNpmRunner(proxy, conf.getString(\"yarn.registryURL\"));\r\n```\r\nRequired:\r\n```\r\n    YarnRunner
