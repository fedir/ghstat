While migrating my app I noticed that the new module favors objects over classes when configuring clients, making it seemingly impossible to use dependency injection for `Authenticator` objects. \r\n\r\nOne such example is configuring a form client. [In the old module](https://github.com/yholkamp/jooby/blob/4718e4c33219114a8536406d8b61d82d97240190/modules/jooby-pac4j/src/main/java/org/jooby/pac4j/Auth.java#L586-L587) you could pass `DbProfileService.class` as argument, while [in the new module](https://github.com/yholkamp/jooby/blob/79899455ba048be8300e4455322b497513c34fd4/modules/jooby-pac4j2/src/main/java/org/jooby/pac4j/Pac4j.java#L557-L583) you can provide a `Authorizer` class and a function that creates a `Client` instance. As the function only receives a `Config` object, there is no way to access the Guice injector. Due to this it's seemingly impossible to use dependency injection to build a `FormClient` with a `DbProfileService`, as the latter would require a `DataSource` instance to be injected.\r\n\r\nI might be missing workaround to still achieve this with the new module but at first glance this makes it complicated to upgrade to the new module when using a database as profile

uses the NpmRunner instead of YarnRunner.\r\nOriginal:\r\n```\r\n    NpmRunner npm = factory.getNpmRunner(proxy, conf.getString(\"yarn.registryURL\"));\r\n```\r\nRequired:\r\n```\r\n    YarnRunner yarn = factory.getYarnRunner(proxy, conf.getString(\"npm.registryURL\"));\r\n```\r\nShould I create a pull request for

I'm giving API Tool its first try. I want to modify the default generated \"operationId\": Joobys prepends the class name (when using MVC) to the method name, so I want that removed.\r\n\r\nSo as per the docs, I've implemented a modifier:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nuse(new ApiTool()\r\n                .modify(routeMethod -> {\r\n                    return true;\r\n                }, routeMethod -> {\r\n                   \r\n
