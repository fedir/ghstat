version 1.3.0 the Pac4j module and its `Auth` class were deprecated in favor of the Pac4j2 module. While migrating my app I noticed that the new module favors objects over classes when configuring clients, making it seemingly impossible to use dependency injection for `Authenticator` objects. \r\n\r\nOne such example is configuring a form client. [In the old module](https://github.com/yholkamp/jooby/blob/4718e4c33219114a8536406d8b61d82d97240190/modules/jooby-pac4j/src/main/java/org/jooby/pac4j/Auth.java#L586-L587) you could pass `DbProfileService.class` as argument, while [in the new module](https://github.com/yholkamp/jooby/blob/79899455ba048be8300e4455322b497513c34fd4/modules/jooby-pac4j2/src/main/java/org/jooby/pac4j/Pac4j.java#L557-L583) you can provide a `Authorizer` class and a function that creates a `Client` instance. As the function only receives a `Config` object, there is no way to access the Guice injector. Due to this it's seemingly impossible to use dependency injection to build a `FormClient` with a `DbProfileService`, as the latter would require a `DataSource` instance to be injected.\r\n\r\nI might be missing workaround to still achieve this with the new module but at first glance this makes it complicated to upgrade to the new module when using a database as profile service.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jooby-project/jooby/issues/1037","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jooby-project/jooby","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jooby-project/jooby/issues/1037/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jooby-project/jooby/issues/1037/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jooby-project/jooby/issues/1037/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/issues/1037","id":299550087,"number":1037,"title":"jooby-frontend Yarn implementation fails to download Yarn","user":{"login":"auxiliaire","id":238566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/238566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/auxiliaire","html_url":"https://github.com/auxiliaire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auxiliaire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auxiliaire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auxiliaire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auxiliaire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auxiliaire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auxiliaire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auxiliaire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auxiliaire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auxiliaire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":139423485,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jooby-project/jooby/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":846202464,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jooby-project/jooby/labels/frontend","name":"frontend","color":"000000","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jooby-project/jooby/milestones/55","html_url":"https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/milestone/55","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jooby-project/jooby/milestones/55/labels","id":3137736,"number":55,"title":"1.3.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"jknack","id":1301129,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1301129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jknack","html_url":"https://github.com/jknack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jknack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jknack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jknack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jknack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jknack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jknack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jknack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jknack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jknack/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":5,"closed_issues":8,"state":"open","created_at":"2018-02-23T00:02:54Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T18:56:25Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-02-22T23:44:10Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T14:10:59Z","closed_at":"2018-02-23T14:10:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"org.jooby.frontend.Yarn cannot download yarn because it tries to download npm instead:\r\n```\r\nINFO  [2018-02-23 00:32:00,439] [Hotswap] Installing npm version v1.3.2\r\nINFO  [2018-02-23 00:32:00,439] [Hotswap] Downloading https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/releases/download/npm-v1.3.2.tgz to C:\\Users\\vikto\\.m2\\repository\\com\\github\\eirslett\\npm\\1.3.2\\npm-1.3.2.tar.gz\r\nINFO  [2018-02-23 00:32:00,440] [Hotswap] No proxies configured\r\nINFO  [2018-02-23 00:32:00,440] [Hotswap] No proxy was configured, downloading directly\r\nINFO  [2018-02-23 00:32:01,637] [Hotswap] Stopped\r\nfebr. 23, 2018 12:32:01 DE org.apache.http.client.protocol.ResponseProcessCookies processCookies\r\nERROR [2018-02-23 00:32:01,639] [Hotswap] An error occurred while starting the application:\r\nWARNING: Invalid cookie header: \"Set-Cookie: logged_in=no; domain=.github.com; path=/; expires=Mon, 22 Feb 2038 23:32:01 -0000; secure; HttpOnly\".

I'm giving API Tool its first try. I want to modify the default generated \"operationId\": Joobys prepends the class name (when using MVC) to the method name, so I want that removed.\r\n\r\nSo as per the docs, I've implemented a modifier:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nuse(new ApiTool()\r\n                .modify(routeMethod -> {\r\n                    return true;\r\n                }, routeMethod -> {\r\n                   \r\n

them breaks the documentation. I am finding it very frustrating to try to write functional code that will also produce the correct documentation.
