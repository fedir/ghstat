redirect on it. I wanted to get rid of this redirect and show the page again when linked to it. However this gets cached, so I had to deploy in order for it to not be a redirect page anymore\r\n\r\n**Issue 2:**\r\nRedirects for pages are severly cached. This 301 gets cached by the browser, so to see the changes, every user of the website should hard refresh (which is off course impossible).

Spoon Database inserts those correctly as 51.0624 and 3.74855 instead of 51 and 3. \r\n\r\nActual solution: in Spoon Library's `database.php` there's some logic that binds values to the statement:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/forkcms/library/blob/master/spoon/database/database.php#L1209-L1213\r\n\r\nThere's a bug in the `getType($value)` function: https://github.com/forkcms/library/blob/master/spoon/database/database.php#L713-L718\r\n\r\nIt considers `floats` to be of type `PDO::PARAM_INT` which should not be the case as it casts the float to an int and inserts an integer in the db. \r\n\r\nThere is no PDO::PARAM for floats and decimals so different sources suggest to use `PDO::PARAM_STR`.  Tl;dr probably a oneliner fix in Spoon Library?
