For most of the endpoints I can immediately respond, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    void MyEndpointApiImpl::get_endpoint_response_sync(Pistache::Http::ResponseWriter &response)\r\n    {\r\n        response.send(Pistache::Http::Code::Ok, \"My sychronous response\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis works fine. However for some endpoints I need to asynchronously (i.e. in my own threads) prepare the response before I can write the response to the ResponseWriter.\r\n\r\nHow can I achieve that with Pistache? Is this possible, i.e. can I provide reference to ResponseWriter (\"response\") to my thread and call respond.send() later?\r\nAlso I do not want to blocking wait for my response to be ready in my endpoint handler method.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am trying something like the following:\r\n\r\n    void MyEndpointApiImpl::get_endpoint_response_async(Pistache::Http::ResponseWriter &response)\r\n    {\r\n         std::thread responseThread([&response]()\r\n          {\r\n                std::string myResponseContent( \"{ status : \\\"1\\\" }\" );\r\n                response.send(Pistache::Http::Code::Ok, myResponseContent,\r\n                        Pistache::Http::Mime::MediaType(\r\n                                Pistache::Http::Mime::Type::Application,\r\n                                Pistache::Http::Mime::Subtype::Json ));\r\n\r\n        });\r\n        responseThread.join();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nWhile I do get the response when I call my server, e.g. via command-line curl the server abort with the following exception:\r\n\r\n    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Pistache::Async::BadType'\r\n    what():  Argument type can not be used to resolve the promise  (TypeId does not match)\r\n  \r\nGenerally I believe this should be possible as in Transport::asyncWrite() there is check in which thread the send() is called and if not in the correct Pistache thread then the response will be queued and handled later in the correct thread.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oktal/pistache/issues/196","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oktal/pistache","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oktal/pistache/issues/196/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oktal/pistache/issues/196/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oktal/pistache/issues/196/events","html_url":"https://github.com/oktal/pistache/issues/196","id":298725681,"number":196,"title":"What
