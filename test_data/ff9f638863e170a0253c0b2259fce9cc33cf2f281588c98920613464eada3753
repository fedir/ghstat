The derive macros in \"extractors.rs\" in gotham_derive contain several instances of the `trace!` and `error!` macros from the \"log\" crate even though it doesn't even have the \"log\" crate as a dependency itself. Commenting those out in gotham_derive gets rid of the errors.\r\n\r\nIt seems like macros inside macros don't get expanded and just leak out into the surrounding code, causing it to basically have an \"invisible\" dependency on the log crate and causing it to fail with complaints about missing macros if the user does not have the \"log\" crate as a dependency and `#[macro_use] extern crate log;` in main. Or, as in my case, if you have another logging crate with incompatible versions of those macros, just give a completely uninformative compile error.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure what the best solution here is, but it seems to me like having macros inside macros is a bad idea, as it basically leaks invisible dependencies into the project using them.\r\n\r\nLink to

discussed on Gitter with @bradleybeddoes, I'm missing the possibility to send new HTTP requests inside Gotham handlers because currently it's not possible to get a reference to the underlying Tokio event loop. \r\n\r\n@bradleybeddoes pointed me to https://github.com/gotham-rs/gotham/blob/953c39b6d5d5134bbab5ab658f1aadc243a68806/src/handler/mod.rs#L151 where other framework state variables are initialized. Unfortunately, I don't see a way of accessing the tokio handle in that function. As a matter of fact the whole Gotham codebase is pretty much unaware of the whole Tokio stuff because the way Gotham apps seem to be started is that the handler is passed to Hyper's server API. Hyper will either create the Tokio core internally, or let you use an existing one (since https://github.com/gotham-rs/gotham/pull/66).\r\n\r\nAn alternative to having Gotham put the handle reference into the state object would be to use a middleware for that: https://github.com/ChristophWurst/gotham-middleware-tokio. You can find an example usage here: https://github.com/ChristophWurst/gotham-middleware-tokio/blob/master/examples/hyper_client.rs#L22\r\n\r\nThere seem to be a few problems though. I don't know whether we should use a `Handle`, a `Remote` or let the developer choose. `Handle` cannot be shared across threads. However, Hyper expects a `Handle` rather than a `Remote` for its client, making it a bit cumbersome to use. The remote object does have method to get a handle, [although it's not guaranteed to always get one](https://docs.rs/tokio-core/0.1.11/tokio_core/reactor/struct.Remote.html#method.handle).\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat related to https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1002\r\n\r\n@bradleybeddoes @smangelsdorf thoughts on how to integrate this in Gotham?\r\n\r\n","score":1.0}]}
