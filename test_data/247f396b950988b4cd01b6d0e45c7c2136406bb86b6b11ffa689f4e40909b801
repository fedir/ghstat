Following the move to 2.1.* mochiweb depends more on the underlying erlang inet module.\r\n\r\nA consequence of this change, is that in 2.0.* if when parsing headers, the receiver buffer was emptied with a binary that did not terminate with a line-feed, the header entry was assumed to be larger than the buffer, and the receive loop would continue to iterate over the whole header that had originally been truncated by the end of the buffer: https://github.com/basho/mochiweb/blob/1.5.1p6/src/mochiweb_http.erl#L136-L192\r\n\r\nNow though, if an individual header entry is received which is bigger than the buffer, the socket server will return a `tcp_error` `emsgsize`, and mochiweb will return a 400 bad request, without logging the reason why: https://github.com/basho/mochiweb/blob/v2.9.0p2/src/mochiweb_http.erl#L75-L77.\r\n\r\nThis causes problems in Riak when secondary index terms become large (e.g. for the NHS when we hit a record a person with hundreds of previous names and addresses).

http://erlang.org/doc/man/inet.html), which causes this limitation (`recbuf` and `sndbuf` are indeed defaulting to much larger values).\r\nThis default value of 1460 seems to be coming from [Erl inet_drv.c](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/56f93ad10f89e6b8d3372e45127ec9fdc3fca35b/erts/emulator/drivers/common/inet_drv.c#L923) and initialized [here](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/56f93ad10f89e6b8d3372e45127ec9fdc3fca35b/erts/emulator/drivers/common/inet_drv.c#L9057).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nInstall CouchDB 2.3 (or build from `master`) and run with default configuration (specifically `chttpd.server_option = [{recbuf, undefined}]`).  \r\nExecute a request with a URL length (excluding protocol and authority) exceeding 1460 characters (method or endpoint appear to be irrelevant).\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nWe are using PouchDB to interact with our CouchDB database and ran into this error with view queries. PouchDB does issue a POST request instead of a GET, but only when the query string exceeds 2000 characters (see [here](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/f87c57a3b3b791dbb62bd881378755ca0a195d13/packages/node_modules/pouchdb-abstract-mapreduce/src/index.js#L262)). \r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n* Version used: 2.3.0, master\r\n* Using: Chrome, cURL, wget\r\n* Operating system: Ubuntu 18, Ubuntu 16 (desktop)\r\n\r\nEven if it is decided that this is desired behavior, I believe this change should at

This is something that could go into an external library, but:\r\n\r\n* I'd like to do TLS at this layer (so it's not bound to socket objects specifically), and in 2017 it really feels like TLS should be an included battery\r\n* Getting started with a simple echo server shouldn't require boilerplate or third-party extensions\r\n* I'm feeling the need for a basic stream abstraction in downstream libraries, and there are interoperability benefits to defining that in `trio` itself\r\n\r\nThe goal wouldn't be to compete with like, all of netty or twisted or something, but just to provide some minimal extensible abstractions for endpoints, connecting, listening. Maybe UDP too, though that can wait.\r\n\r\nThings that should be easy:\r\n\r\n* Connecting to a given hostname+port, with ipv4/ipv6 taken care of (ideally with happy-eyeballs)\r\n* ...same as above, but with TLS enabled\r\n* Making a simple server that listens on both ipv4 and ipv6\r\n* Making a simple server that listens on a unix domain port\r\n\r\nMaybe:\r\n* Plugging in some code to handle systemd socket activation\r\n* Plugging in some code to do something sensible with the [haproxy PROXY protocol](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt)\r\n\r\nA source of inspiration is twisted's \"endpoints\": [tutorial](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/endpoints.html), [list of client endpoints](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IStreamClientEndpoint.html), [list of server endpoints](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IStreamServerEndpoint.html), [a much fancier server endpoint](https://txacme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). I'm not a big fan of the plugins + string parsing thing, just because of the whole injecting-arbitrary-code-into-people's-processes thing that plugins do ... though I see the advantage when it comes to exposing this stuff as part of a public interface and wanting it to be extensible there.\r\n\r\nWe probably want:\r\n\r\n* A basic Stream API. There's a sketch in `trio._streams`. This is useful in its own right; the idea would be to implement TLS as a stream wrapper e.g., and we can use a `SendStream` and `RecvStream` for subprocess pipes, etc.\r\n\r\n* Some sort of connect

A customer said their end-users often use a such large query because of multibyte character set, and complicated condition in a query. see: zd#11091\n\nNote: [recbuf's behaviour depends on a platform.](https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb/blob/b66b68d95c9e1b2a32b194202e870e6d1e232eb7/src/mochiweb_socket_server.erl#L122-L133)\n#### Solutions:\n1. Expose recbuf option: As the latest mochi/mochiweb has the change of exposing recbuf, we can expose the option by applying new changes in mochi/mochiweb, and updating webmachine a bit.
