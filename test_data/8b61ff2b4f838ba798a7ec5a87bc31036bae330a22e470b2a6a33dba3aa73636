I don't even see app_sessions collection being created in the mongo db.\r\n\r\nUpon inspecting keystoneJS code base, issue seems to be because of the way `keystone/lib/core/initExpressApp.js` is written.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = function initExpressApp (customApp) {\r\n       //When i use keystone.set('app', app);,\r\n       //below if causes rest of the steps to be skipped.\r\n\tif (this.app) return this; \r\n\tthis.initDatabaseConfig();\r\n\tthis.initExpressSession(this.mongoose);\r\n\tif (customApp) {\r\n\t\tthis.app = customApp;\r\n\t\trequire('../../server/createApp')(this);\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tthis.app = require('../../server/createApp')(this);\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn this;\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen you look at `if (this.app) return this;`, When using keystone.set('app', app); this IF causes rest of the steps to be skipped, which seem to be needed for the creation of mongo based session store.

This issue was introduced by PR #4453, specifically the updated [knox dependency](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/v4.0.0-beta.8/package.json#L54). It requires git for installation, which is not included in the production-focused node Docker images.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n\r\n* add `apt-get install git` to the Dockerfile before `npm install`\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n\r\n* replace the `keystonejs/knox` dependency with [knox-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knox-s3) (as discussed in Automattic/knox#326)\r\n* publish `keystonejs/knox` to npm\r\n* remove knox altogether, and replace with an alternative like [aws-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk)\r\n\r\nIf using knox-s3 is good enough for now, I'd be happy to submit a PR.

After applying this setting, I noticed that the list pages no longer show the list of items and get frozen with endless progress animation. Inspection in dev tools shows that request to /keystone/api/ (in new case, /customadminpath/api) does not go out. If I make a GET request to /customadminpath/api/... manually, I receive a correct response with the list of items, so it rather seems like the front-end application issue. \r\nI'm slightly familiar and can take a look at this matter.
