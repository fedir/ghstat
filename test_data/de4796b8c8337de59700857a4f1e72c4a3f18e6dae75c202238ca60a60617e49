Thank you.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Short description of the issue\r\n\r\nWhen A page contains `Page Refference` fields, the ProDarfts moduls runs into infinite loops while `ProDrafts::getPageDifferences`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe page should be saved.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen you save a page or accept a Draft the page loads very long and is not correctly saved.\r\nI did a deeper look into the modul to find the reason for this error and found out:\r\n\r\n- The function `ProcessWire\\ProDrafts::getPageDifferences()` runs in a endles loop until `max_execution_time` is reached\r\n  - That happens because:\r\n    - the function checks each field in the page for possible differences.\r\n    - For fields of type `Page` and `PageArray` the function calls itself recursively to check all differences in the Page-/PageArray\r\n      - When the field created with PageReference the Function checks the whole linked page for differences too\r\n      - When this linked page contains other PageReference field, it follows them and does the next recursiv call\r\n\r\n- The big problem comes when the linked pages have direct or indirect backlinks to one of the pages that contain the link to them. in that case the modul runs in an endles deep resursion.\r\ne.g. the simple case is (Each page has a link to the other, so the modul)\r\n```\r\nPageA -> PageB -> PageA\r\n```\r\nOr more complex case:\r\n```\r\nPageA -> PageB -> PageC ...... PageZ -> PageA\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Optional: Screenshots/Links that demonstrate the issue\r\n\r\nYour screenshots/links go here.\r\n\r\n### Optional: Suggestion for a possible fix\r\n\r\nA small change `ProDrafts.modul`:\r\n  BEFORE the Recursiv calls in `getPageDifferences line 1026` and `getPageDifferences line 1037 you should check if the field is a `PageReference` \r\n  - if YES dont do a recursive call, Yust compare if the IDs of the Target-Page are changed\r\n  - if NO continue with Recursive calls\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n<!-- Provide an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce the issue. -->\r\n\r\n1. Install and setup `ProDrafts` Modul \r\n2. Create 2 Pages containg a `PageReference` - Field (Or any other field that contains a `PageReference` field)\r\n3. Choose a Refference to the First Page (PageA) in the Reference Field of the First page\r\n4. Suggest a Draft for PageB and set a link to PageA\r\n5. Try to save this page and/or accept the Draft\r\n\r\n\r\n### Setup/Environment\r\n* ProcessWire version: 3.0.164\r\n* Modul `ProDrafts v 0.0.8`  \r\n- Modul `Page Reference  v 1.0.5`\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Short description of the issue\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to the unsolved circular reference problem with single Page Reference field that has been raised several times:\r\nhttps://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues/issues/152\r\nhttps://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues/issues/572\r\nhttps://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues/issues/842\r\n\r\nBut different in that it can affect the current $page object in hooks.\r\n\r\nHere is a demonstration...\r\n\r\nI have a template \"test-page-reference\" which contains a \"single\" Page Reference field named \"select_page\". In a page using this template I select the page titled \"A basic page\".\r\n\r\n![2020-02-18_193717](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1538852/74710288-1df65680-5286-11ea-9673-9aa838bc5783.png)\r\n\r\nIf I have a Pages::saveReady hook as follows then it becomes impossible to save changes to \"A basic page\".\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$pages->addHookBefore('saveReady', function(HookEvent $event) {\r\n    $page = $event->arguments(0);\r\n    $pages = $event->object;\r\n\r\n    if($page->template == 'basic-page') {\r\n        // Suppose I want to make something conditional on the value of another page...\r\n\r\n        // I get another page\r\n        $another_page = $pages->get(\"template=test-page-reference\");\r\n        // I get the value of a \"single\" Page Reference field in the other page\r\n        $selected_page = $another_page->select_page;\r\n\r\n        // If $selected_page happens to be this page that is currently being saved\r\n        // then all current changes to $page are lost\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n![pagesave](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1538852/74710526-bb518a80-5286-11ea-90a3-70ffae10b9b9.gif)\r\n\r\nAnd I'm puzzled why it's not possible to work around this problem like so:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$pages->addHookBefore('saveReady', function(HookEvent $event) {\r\n    $page = $event->arguments(0);\r\n    $pages = $event->object;\r\n\r\n    if($page->template == 'basic-page') {\r\n        $clone = clone $page;\r\n        $another_page = $pages->get(\"template=test-page-reference\");\r\n        $selected_page = $another_page->select_page;\r\n        $event->arguments(0, $clone);\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above does work with a hook before Pages::save but not with Pages::saveReady which is normally preferred.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to solve these issues with single Page Reference fields but I think it's important to get some solution because these sorts of side effects are quite unexpected. Maybe a single Page Reference field should return a clone of the Page object in case the page is already in memory?\r\n\r\n### Setup/Environment\r\n\r\n* ProcessWire version: 3.0.150\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/processwire/processwire-issues/issues/1151","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/processwire/processwire-issues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/processwire/processwire-issues/issues/1151/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/processwire/processwire-issues/issues/1151/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/processwire/processwire-issues/issues/1151/events","html_url":"https://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues/issues/1151","id":601369383,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MDEzNjkzODM=","number":1151,"title":"Page List Select Multiple doesn't allow selecting root page","user":{"login":"teppokoivula","id":1252021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1252021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teppokoivula","html_url":"https://github.com/teppokoivula","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teppokoivula/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teppokoivula/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teppokoivula/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teppokoivula/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teppokoivula/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teppokoivula/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teppokoivula/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teppokoivula/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teppokoivula/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":779754321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3Nzk3NTQzMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/processwire/processwire-issues/labels/status:%20can't%20reproduce","name":"status: can't reproduce","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2020-04-16T19:23:39Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T12:24:31Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T12:24:31Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Short description of the issue\r\n\r\nFirst of all I'm not entirely sure if this is how it _should_ work, but when I'm using Page List Select Multiple inputfield (not sure but presumably this also applies to Page List Select), instructions on Input tab state the following (emphasis added):\r\n\r\n> You have selected an input type that has specific requirements.

Create two page reference fields on the same template\r\n2. Select Page 1 from Page 2 for one of the fields\r\n3. Select Page 2 from Page 1 for the other field\r\n4.
