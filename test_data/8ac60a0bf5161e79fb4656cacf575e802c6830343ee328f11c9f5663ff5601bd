Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/fervent-gates-8oqig\r\nwatch the console.log output\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI use `<nuxt keep-alive/>` inside `layouts/default.vue`. And I use `watch: { '$route.query': this.$fetch() }` inside of a UI component. If I move from one page to another, `this.$fetch()` is triggered all the time, even if the UI component (which whatches the route) is not inside the page. It doesn't has to do with `$fetch()`, I could also call a method instead. It is an issue with `watch` and `keep-alive`. The question is why is this happening?\r\n\r\nAlso the docs are kinda misleading:\r\nhttps://nuxtjs.org/api/pages-fetch#listening-to-query-string-changes\r\nhttps://nuxtjs.org/api/pages-fetch#caching\r\n\r\nBecause they state:\r\n\r\n>You can use keep-alive directive in `<nuxt/>` and `<nuxt-child/>` component to save fetch calls on pages you already visited.\r\n\r\nBut exactly the opposite happens. If I remove `keep-alive` from `<nuxt/>`, then `$fetch()` is only triggered if I am on the page, which contains the UI component (which watches `$route.query`) and this way I actually save fetch calls on pages. If I do it like its stated in the docs `fetch()` is called all the time.\r\n\r\n### What is Expected?\r\nWhat is written in the docs\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe opposite","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt-community/gtm-module/issues/68","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt-community/gtm-module","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt-community/gtm-module/issues/68/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt-community/gtm-module/issues/68/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt-community/gtm-module/issues/68/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nuxt-community/gtm-module/issues/68","id":689049044,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODkwNDkwNDQ=","number":68,"title":"Support fix for rogue referral problem","user":{"login":"everyx","id":1665522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjU1MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1665522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/everyx","html_url":"https://github.com/everyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/everyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/everyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/everyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/everyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/everyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/everyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/everyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/everyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/everyx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1836445007,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2NDQ1MDA3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt-community/gtm-module/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":"New feature or request"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2020-08-31T09:08:37Z","updated_at":"2020-09-24T10:54:23Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T04:06:20Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"More detail : https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/6366","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/8252","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/8252/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/8252/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/8252/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/8252","id":729623320,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3Mjk2MjMzMjA=","number":8252,"title":"Support Webpack 5","user":{"login":"daniluk4000","id":10450717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDUwNzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10450717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniluk4000","html_url":"https://github.com/daniluk4000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniluk4000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniluk4000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniluk4000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniluk4000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniluk4000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniluk4000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniluk4000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniluk4000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniluk4000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":882702389,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4ODI3MDIzODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt.js/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"93ea70","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-10-26T14:40:29Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T08:48:37Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T08:48:37Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I know that you are developing Nuxt 3 now, and I'm sure it will support Webpack 5, but will you add support of it in 2.x?
