would like to be able to change the number of frames per second, because for web applications and for smartphones 60 frames is a lot (`Vsync`- 60 or no limit, it is known).\r\nI studied the source code of the `Armory` engine and its abstraction levels (`Armory`, `Iron`, `Kha`) and came to the following conclusions:\r\n1. there is currently no way to change the number of frames via `Armory`and `Iron`;\r\n2. there are also no settings via `Kha`:\r\n- the `render` function that is registered to execute as `kha.System.notifyOnFrames()` and will run with a limit of 60. Because it depends on the call event on the chosen platform;\r\n- adds the `update` function to the `Scheduler` and you can specify the frequency of more execution. You can specify a value of 30 and it turns out that the scene is render 2 times, and updated 1 time. Because neither are executed in parallel.\r\nTo specify this setting, either in the `Display` class (it is located in `ArmorySDK\\Kha\\Backends\\[target_name]\\kha`), you need to specify a value for the platform in the `get_frequency()` function. Or, in the `Time` class of the `Iron` engine (`ArmorySDK\\iron\\Sources\\iron\\system`) in the `init()` function, specify the frequency value instead of what is there.\r\n\r\nCan make changes to `Iron`:\r\nTo make the `render` function run with the same frequency as `update`, you can register an “empty function” in `kha.System.notifyOnFrames()` (only to store the value from the `frames[0]` array passed in the `framebuffer` field). And execute the real function in `update`. In this case, the empty function will still be executed 60 times, but the “workers” will only be 30.\r\nAnd for the “correct” display of the FPS value in the `DebugConsole` and in the `Get FPS` node, it is necessary to correct that the time during the calculation was used from `Scheduler`, and not the real one (which will produce 60 FPS).\r\nI haven’t been able to find any other way to limit the frames per second other than upgrading the `Iron`. In this case, you can display settings in the nodes or the _Blender_ interface. But this is a limitation at the level of one of the abstraction layers. And make it optional, if the user left the FPS limit at 60, then everything will work according to the current algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe developers `Kha` are in no hurry to introduce such a possibility (judging by the topics on the forum (http://forum.kode.tech/topic/329/building-a-desktop-app-render-on-demand) and the request in git (https://github.com/Kode/Kha/issues/320)).\r\n\r\nI wrote the results of my searches here (https://forums.armory3d.org/t/set-limit-framerate-ln-for-get-fps/4286/8).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this? Is there any other way to solve this problem?\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FabricMC/fabric/issues/1154","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FabricMC/fabric","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FabricMC/fabric/issues/1154/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FabricMC/fabric/issues/1154/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FabricMC/fabric/issues/1154/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/issues/1154","id":738281895,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzgyODE4OTU=","number":1154,"title":"Ore
