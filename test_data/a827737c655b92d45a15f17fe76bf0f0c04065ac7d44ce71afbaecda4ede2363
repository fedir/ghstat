The previous default implementation used by Play 2.7 that came from Jackson was using PUBLIC_ONLY for field detection. \r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/jackson-databind-2.10.5/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/introspect/VisibilityChecker.java#L169 \r\n```\r\n       protected final static Std DEFAULT = new Std(\r\n                Visibility.PUBLIC_ONLY, // getter\r\n                Visibility.PUBLIC_ONLY, // is-getter\r\n                Visibility.ANY, // setter\r\n                Visibility.ANY, // creator -- legacy, to support single-arg ctors\r\n                Visibility.PUBLIC_ONLY // field\r\n                );\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo\r\n```\r\npublic class MyClass { private String myField }\r\n// myField  won't be in the json\r\n```\r\nNow that Play 2.8 is using Jackson Serialization Support [[1]](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/Migration28#ObjectMapper-serialization-change), akka-serialization-jackson seems to be overriding visibility for fields to ALL (even private/protected ones)\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/v2.6.10/akka-serialization-jackson/src/main/scala/akka/serialization/jackson/JacksonObjectMapperProvider.scala#L248\r\n```\r\n mapper.setVisibility(PropertyAccessor.FIELD, JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.ANY)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo\r\n```\r\npublic class MyClass { private String myField }\r\n// myField  will be in the json\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can test that this is the problem by annotating your ebean with `@JsonAutoDetect(fieldVisibility = Visibility.PUBLIC_ONLY)`, the problem will be fixed.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that there is no mention to this fact in Play's documentation and also it doesn't seem to exist any easy way to fix/override that setting. \r\n\r\nI am wondering if I should open a feature/bug request in akka (for customization of visibility), but since it seems like a regression from a playframework's user perspective.\r\n\r\nI think the place we could override this setting in Play is this one:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/ddf3a7ee4285212ec665826ec268ef32b5a76000/core/play-java/src/main/scala/play/core/ObjectMapperModule.scala#L33\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nYou will probably have to create your own module and override the ObjectMapper. By doing this, you will also lose the advantages of having Akka Jackson Serialization (and configs).\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/play-file-watch/issues/100","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/play-file-watch","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/play-file-watch/issues/100/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/play-file-watch/issues/100/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/play-file-watch/issues/100/events","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/play-file-watch/issues/100","id":708254396,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MDgyNTQzOTY=","number":100,"title":"The

the same across libraries, and they should not reference libraries with known CVE's, for example [CVE-2020-5421](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5421) which is in any release older than:\r\n\r\n1. \"org.springframework\" % \"spring-beans\" % \"5.2.9.RELEASE\"\r\n2. \"org.springframework\" % \"spring-context\" % \"5.2.9.RELEASE\"\r\n3. \"org.springframework\" % \"spring-core\" % \"5.2.9.RELEASE\"\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nYou are using a mix of dependency versions across libraries that don't agree (for example, com.typesafe.play:play-streams_2.13:2.8.2 is using com.typesafe.akka:akka-stream_2.13:**2.6.5**, but com.typesafe.play:play-ws-standalone_2.13:2.1.2 is using com.typesafe.akka:akka-stream_2.13:**2.6.1**).\r\nThe transitive dependencies should be consistent across libraries.\r\n\r\nThe real issue here is the version of _springframework_ being brought in here by _some_ of the transitive dependencies\r\ncontains a security vulnerability that

This technique \r\nis impervious to format change and because the valid Java version labels are in a text file\r\nit is possible to update with version addition or removal without rebuilding the whole project.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lagom/lagom/issues/3009","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lagom/lagom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lagom/lagom/issues/3009/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lagom/lagom/issues/3009/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lagom/lagom/issues/3009/events","html_url":"https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/3009","id":681973954,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODE5NzM5NTQ=","number":3009,"title":"Lagom not enabling akka grpc client module","user":{"login":"venkateshzifo","id":40033622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDMzNjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/40033622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkateshzifo","html_url":"https://github.com/venkateshzifo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkateshzifo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkateshzifo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkateshzifo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkateshzifo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkateshzifo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkateshzifo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkateshzifo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkateshzifo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkateshzifo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2020-08-19T16:20:17Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T12:25:18Z","closed_at":"2020-08-21T12:25:18Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Lagom Version (1.2.x / 1.3.x / etc)\r\n1.6.2\r\n\r\n\r\n### API (Scala / Java / Neither / Both)\r\nJava\r\n\r\n### JDK (Oracle 1.8.0_112, OpenJDK 1.8.x, Azul Zing)\r\nAdoptOpenJDK 11\r\n\r\nPaste the output from `java -version` at the command line.\r\n\r\n### Library Dependencies\r\nakka-grpc\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nlagom should be up and running with mvn lagom:runAll \r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nFacing this issue now when starting lagom with mvn lagom:runAll Cannot load module[Module [example.myapp.helloworld.grpc.AkkaGrpcClientModule] cannot be instantiated.] \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forcedotcom/stargate/issues/14","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forcedotcom/stargate","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forcedotcom/stargate/issues/14/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forcedotcom/stargate/issues/14/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forcedotcom/stargate/issues/14/events","html_url":"https://github.com/forcedotcom/stargate/issues/14","id":649572421,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDk1NzI0MjE=","number":14,"title":"Play Session cookie not deleted on logout when MaxAge is not set","user":{"login":"wandliu","id":2737983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Mzc5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2737983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wandliu","html_url":"https://github.com/wandliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wandliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wandliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wandliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wandliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wandliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wandliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wandliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wandliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wandliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-07-02T03:02:03Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T04:42:39Z","closed_at":"2020-07-02T04:42:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"A necessary patch was recently applied to clear the play session cookie upon logout to address the following issue.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/10122\r\n\r\nThis patch overwrites the play session cookie set to be discarded immediately.
