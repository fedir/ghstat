This registration process can cause a CP to be updated, and I want to render the the updated value of the CP on the first \"paint\".\r\n\r\nThe code can be found [here](https://github.com/alexlafroscia/ember-steps/blob/a01fb02e7cff69528af01f187304d90ddcc2b638/addon/components/step-manager.js#L157-L166) for reference.\r\n\r\nBefore Ember 1.13 the CP would just be computed twice in a single render, which was fine. But Ember 2 breaks that behavior (for understandable reasons).\r\n\r\nRight now, I schedule a callback in the `actions` queue during render which triggers the CP change, and the next run loop updates the DOM accordingly. This has been working fine until Ember 3.1, where that second \"render\" cycle doesn't happen during tests. An example test can be found [here](https://github.com/alexlafroscia/ember-steps/blob/a01fb02e7cff69528af01f187304d90ddcc2b638/tests/integration/step-manager-test.js#L160-L175).\r\n\r\nUsing that as an example, what was happening before was that the `render` function resolved once the run queue was empty, so that when I go to validate that the first step is visible, the CP has already updated and made the step visible. However, now the CP has not been re-computed yet, meaning that the step is not yet visible. This causes a lot of these tests to fail.\r\n\r\nMy question then is two-fold:\r\n1. Was this change intentional?\r\n2. If it was, what would be the right way to approach a declarative API like this now?\r\n\r\nWith so much of Ember's power coming from the template, it seems like moving in the wrong direction to break some of the behavior that allowed for declarative APIs like the one in that addon.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16455","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16455/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16455/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16455/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16455","id":310756841,"number":16455,"title":"Typo in shouldRender documentation","user":{"login":"amessinger","id":3007703,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3007703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger","html_url":"https://github.com/amessinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":394458286,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/labels/Has%20PR","name":"Has PR","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-03T09:19:59Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T15:48:50Z","closed_at":"2018-04-06T15:48:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Currently, `shouldRender` documentation states that setting its value to `true` will disable rendering.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/84c8ecac85175571047690540f1dea7e62115c64/packages/ember-application/lib/system/application-instance.js#L377-L379\r\n\r\nSetting its value to `false` will actually disable rendering. `true` is the default value and will cause the application to render.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16451","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16451/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16451/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16451/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16451","id":310365370,"number":16451,"title":"Ember 3.0 Regression: Unable to addObject to an ArrayProxy","user":{"login":"bryanhickerson","id":8365065,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8365065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson","html_url":"https://github.com/bryanhickerson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-04-02T00:17:07Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T05:13:16Z","closed_at":"2018-04-02T05:12:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In ember 2.18, I am able to use `addObject` to add a new record to an existing collection that was fetched via `queryRecord`.

Inspecting a `transition` object there is the `intent` object that is used to apply proper state. This can be a `URLTransitionIntent` or a `NamedTransitionIntent`. For inter-app `link-to` this is a `NamedTransitionIntent`. In order to properly apply state, the `contexts: []` property on this object must be correctly set.
