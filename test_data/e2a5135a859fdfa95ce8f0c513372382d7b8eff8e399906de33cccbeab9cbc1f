Summary\r\n\r\nNow that the [Angle Bracket Invocation RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.md) has been merged (🎉) this issue aims to track landing the functionality proposed there behind the `EMBER_GLIMMER_ANGLE_BRACKET_INVOCATION` feature flag.\r\n\r\nWhere possible individual items will cross link to the related section of the RFC.\r\n\r\n#### Features\r\n\r\n- [x] Static invocation of existing `Ember.Component` based components via angle brackets with \"capital case\" component naming (e.g. `<FooBar></FooBar>` would find `app/components/foo-bar.js`). [Relevant RFC Section](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.md#tag-name)\r\n- [x] Allowing single word component names (as long as they begin with a capital letter). [Relevant RFC Section](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.md#tag-name)\r\n- [x] Support for passing named arguments into the component being invoked (e.g. `<FooBar @foo={{somethingSpecial}}></FooBar>`).\r\n- [x] Support for passing HTML attributes [Relevant RFC Section](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.md#html-attributes)\r\n  - [x] Should add the specified attributes to an element containing `...attributes` \r\n  - [x] Should add the specified attributes to the wrapping element when `tagName` is not `''`\r\n  - [x] Attributes should be added _after_ those specified by the component itself (and therefore \"overridable\")\r\n  - [x] `class` attribute should be merged with those in the specified element\r\n- [x] Block support\r\n  - [x] Block can be passed to the invoked component and yielded to.\r\n  - [x] `has-block` should be `false` for \"self closing\" invocations (e.g. `<FooBar />`)\r\n  - [x] `has-block` should be `true` for normal (not self closing) invocations (e.g. `<FooBar></FooBar>`)\r\n- [x] Dynamic Invocations [Relevant RFC Section](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.md#dynamic-invocations)\r\n  - [x] Allow invocation of block params within scope (casing rules are not applicable)\r\n  - [x] Allow invocations that are path lookups (e.g. `<this.foo></this.foo>`)\r\n  - [x] Allow invocations that are named blocks (e.g. `<@foo></@foo>`)\r\n\r\n#### Implementation TODO's\r\n\r\n- [x] Update `simple-html-tokenizer` to support `<@foo></@foo>` https://github.com/tildeio/simple-html-tokenizer/pull/62 & https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-vm/pull/818\r\n- [x]  Update glimmer-vm to avoid calling `didCreateElement` on the component's manager for _every_ usage of `...attributes` https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-vm/pull/820\r\n- [x] Ensure `has-block` is false for self closing component invocations (e.g. `<FooBar />`) https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-vm/pull/819\r\n- [x] Implement support for dynamic angle bracket invocation https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-vm/pull/822\r\n- [x] Implement support for implicit `...attributes` in the Ember.Component wrapper element https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-vm/pull/823","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16682","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16682/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16682/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16682/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16682","id":325867873,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjU4Njc4NzM=","number":16682,"title":"doc typo: Core Concepts","user":{"login":"mikesamuel","id":368886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/368886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesamuel","html_url":"https://github.com/mikesamuel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesamuel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesamuel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesamuel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesamuel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesamuel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesamuel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesamuel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesamuel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesamuel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-05-23T20:48:53Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T04:03:19Z","closed_at":"2018-05-25T04:03:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The `/` in line 5 of the code fragment below seems like a typo.\r\n\r\nhttps://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/core-concepts/ says\r\n\r\n> /app/components/foo-did-render-example.js\r\n> ```js\r\n> import Component from '@ember/component';\r\n> \r\n> export default Component.extend({\r\n>   didRender() {\r\n>     this._super(...arguments/);

Naturally, I'd like to wrap that under a `debounce` so the action to be done doesn't fire crazily. What I've found out is that the `debounce` for a scroll listener when attached to `window` is very slow **for Chrome**. I've set a timer of 150ms but it seems to use 1000+ms. The same issue doesn't happen in Firefox and Edge. Also, attaching the scroll listener to any element other than `window` seems to work fine in Chrome.\r\n\r\nSince the issue happens in `window`, I can't replicate it in Ember Twiddle so I've put up a [repo](https://github.com/rmmmp/ember-debounce-bug) to show the bug. It uses Ember ~3.1.0.\r\n\r\nI don't believe this is a Chrome issue as I've tried removing the `debounce` and everything fires correctly. No delay or anything.

I’ve tried it with Ember 3.1.2 and 3.2.0-beta.4.\r\n\r\nWhen running the tests, many of them [fail](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/travis-web/builds/378750218#L639) with this message (our suite uses Chrome):\r\n\r\n> Cannot read property 'trigger' of undefined\r\n\r\nIn digging into the stacktrace, I found that the [line in question](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/470dddb9bbea32f0bf71219740b22c8dc8ecf68d/packages/ember-routing/lib/system/router.js#L440) is in `packages/ember-routing/lib/system/router.js`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  send() {\r\n    /*name, context*/\r\n    this._routerMicrolib.trigger(...arguments);\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat’s [called by](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/packages/ember-runtime/lib/mixins/action_handler.js#L199-L219) `packages/ember-runtime/lib/mixins/action_handler.js#send`.\r\n\r\nLower in the stack, there’s some `travis-web`-specific code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'trigger' of undefined\r\n    at Class.send (http://localhost:4200/assets/vendor.js:56252:49)\r\n    at Class.send (http://localhost:4200/assets/vendor.js:60528:21)\r\n    at Class.buildStateDidChange (http://localhost:4200/assets/travis.js:8780:14)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe job controller has [an observer](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-web/blob/873cc0e63642f0e878fc6f4dba50739975e86da2/app/controllers/job.js#L21-L24) for `job.state`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @observes('job.state')\r\n  jobStateDidChange() {\r\n    return this.send('faviconStateDidChange', this.get('job.state'));\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build controller has something [almost identical](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-web/blob/873cc0e63642f0e878fc6f4dba50739975e86da2/app/controllers/build.js#L36-L41).\r\n\r\nThe `faviconStateDidChange` action is [defined](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-web/blob/873cc0e63642f0e878fc6f4dba50739975e86da2/app/mixins/build-favicon.js#L8-L14) in a `build-favicon` mixin that’s _only_ [mixed into the application route](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-web/blob/cf651111b9181867f2a56e2c14ace016df3413e4/app/routes/application.js#L11):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    faviconStateDidChange(state) {\r\n      if (state) {\r\n        return this.setFaviconForState(state);\r\n      } else {\r\n        return this.setDefault();\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis all looks innocuous to me; I tried removing the code within the action and that didn’t change anything. I also tried merging the mixin’s code directly into the application route, which also didn’t do anything. It seems like the code to bubble the action is the problem more than the action code itself.\r\n\r\nA strange aspect of this is that when I actually use the interface myself rather than run the tests, I can see that the favicon is updating, so the action is indeed being sent and run. So it seems like it’s only a problem in tests? 🤔 \r\n\r\nLet me know if there’s any other information I can provide!
