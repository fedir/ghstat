This registration process can cause a CP to be updated, and I want to render the the updated value of the CP on the first \"paint\".\r\n\r\nThe code can be found [here](https://github.com/alexlafroscia/ember-steps/blob/a01fb02e7cff69528af01f187304d90ddcc2b638/addon/components/step-manager.js#L157-L166) for reference.\r\n\r\nBefore Ember 1.13 the CP would just be computed twice in a single render, which was fine. But Ember 2 breaks that behavior (for understandable reasons).\r\n\r\nRight now, I schedule a callback in the `actions` queue during render which triggers the CP change, and the next run loop updates the DOM accordingly. This has been working fine until Ember 3.1, where that second \"render\" cycle doesn't happen during tests. An example test can be found [here](https://github.com/alexlafroscia/ember-steps/blob/a01fb02e7cff69528af01f187304d90ddcc2b638/tests/integration/step-manager-test.js#L160-L175).\r\n\r\nUsing that as an example, what was happening before was that the `render` function resolved once the run queue was empty, so that when I go to validate that the first step is visible, the CP has already updated and made the step visible. However, now the CP has not been re-computed yet, meaning that the step is not yet visible. This causes a lot of these tests to fail.\r\n\r\nMy question then is two-fold:\r\n1. Was this change intentional?\r\n2. If it was, what would be the right way to approach a declarative API like this now?\r\n\r\nWith so much of Ember's power coming from the template, it seems like moving in the wrong direction to break some of the behavior that allowed for declarative APIs like the one in that addon.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16455","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16455/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16455/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16455/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16455","id":310756841,"number":16455,"title":"Typo in shouldRender documentation","user":{"login":"amessinger","id":3007703,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3007703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger","html_url":"https://github.com/amessinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amessinger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":394458286,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/labels/Has%20PR","name":"Has PR","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-03T09:19:59Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T15:48:50Z","closed_at":"2018-04-06T15:48:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Currently, `shouldRender` documentation states that setting its value to `true` will disable rendering.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/84c8ecac85175571047690540f1dea7e62115c64/packages/ember-application/lib/system/application-instance.js#L377-L379\r\n\r\nSetting its value to `false` will actually disable rendering. `true` is the default value and will cause the application to render.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16451","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16451/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16451/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16451/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16451","id":310365370,"number":16451,"title":"Ember 3.0 Regression: Unable to addObject to an ArrayProxy","user":{"login":"bryanhickerson","id":8365065,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8365065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson","html_url":"https://github.com/bryanhickerson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanhickerson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-04-02T00:17:07Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T05:13:16Z","closed_at":"2018-04-02T05:12:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In ember 2.18, I am able to use `addObject` to add a new record to an existing collection that was fetched via `queryRecord`.

To accomplish this, I have a service where a `lastTransition` can be set, and the \"entry point\" routes use the `beforeModel(transition)` hook to set this `lastTransition`.\r\n\r\nI found certain instances where I could break the app by first transitioning to a parent page from a dynamic `link-to`, then steping through the series of pages. On completion of the series of pages, using the service to access the `lastTransition`, `transition.retry()` would be called. In this instance the app would break.\r\n\r\nUpon closer inspection I noticed the difference between the working scenarios and the broken scenarios was the dynamic `link-to` click. Inspecting a `transition` object there is the `intent` object that is used to apply proper state. This can be a `URLTransitionIntent` or a `NamedTransitionIntent`. For inter-app `link-to` this is a `NamedTransitionIntent`. In order to properly apply state, the `contexts: []` property on this object must be correctly set. I found after clicking the dynamic `link-to` when I went to store the `transition` that the `contexts: []` property was always empty.\r\n\r\nMy work around was to grab the proper parameters, set the `contexts: []` array manually, and then store the `transition`. \r\n\r\n```\r\nbeforeModel(transition) {\r\n  let intent = transition.intent;\r\n\r\n  if (intent && intent.contexts &&

The behaviour is exactly as expected but when I was running the tests I got `ReferenceError: dataTracker is not defined`, where `dataTracker` comes from a JS library and significant numbers of tests failing.\r\n\r\nLocally, I can solve the issue by wrapping the section of code which calls `dataTracker` in:\r\n```\r\nif (!testing) {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo now the Mixin looks like this:\r\n```\r\n/* global dataTracker */\r\nimport Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';\r\nimport Ember from 'ember';\r\n\r\nconst { testing } = Ember;\r\n\r\nexport default Mixin.create({\r\n notifyAdobeAnalytics() {\r\n  if(!testing) {\r\n   let payload = someJSON\r\n\t\r\n   dataTracker.trackEvent('newPage', payload);\r\n   }\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fixes the (many!) broken tests and the behaviour is unaffected... Perfect!\r\n\r\nHowever, when running the same tests in the Heroku staging environment, the same error message is thrown as I was previously getting locally, before adding the `if(!testing)`.\r\n\r\nElsewhere I have looked in our codebase, using the `testing` constant is working normally with Heroku elsewhere so I am unsure as to why it is breaking here. I cannot find any reason why on Heroku I am getting the same error as has been fixed locally.\r\n\r\nAll error logs are of the structure:\r\n```\r\nReferenceError: dataTracker is not defined\r\n    at Class.notifyAdobeAnalytics (http://localhost:4200/assets/hivebench-frontend/mixins/adobe-analytics.js:50:1)\r\n    at Class.didTransition (http://localhost:4200/assets/hivebench-frontend/mixins/adobe-analytics.js:24:1)\r\n    at Router$1.triggerEvent (http://localhost:4200/assets/ember-routing/system/router.js:1023:1)\r\n    at trigger (http://localhost:4200/assets/router.js:111:1)\r\n    at finalizeTransition (http://localhost:4200/assets/router.js:2018:1)\r\n    at http://localhost:4200/assets/router.js:1402:1\r\n    at tryCatcher (http://localhost:4200/assets/rsvp.js:215:1)\r\n    at invokeCallback (http://localhost:4200/assets/rsvp.js:393:1)\r\n    at publish (http://localhost:4200/assets/rsvp.js:379:1)\r\n    at http://localhost:4200/assets/ember-testing/ext/rsvp.js:14:1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried adding it as a global variable by putting `/* global dataTracker */` at the top of the page and various other things but nothing has worked so far.\r\n\r\nThe only issues I can find which look  _vaguely_ related are these:\r\nhttps://github.com/emberjs/ember-qunit/issues/297#issuecomment-352385666\r\nhttps://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16006\r\nBut they do not have the same problem as I am having.\r\n\r\nI am using Ember version 2.16.2 and ember-cli-qunit version 4.0.1\r\n\r\nTo reiterate,  everything is working exactly as desired, it is only when running the tests in staging that I came across this problem.

The runloop spends one microtask per queue, so our stack of promise resolutions is interleaved with each queue's flush. In the above example, we schedule on the `actions` queue immediately after that queue has just flushed, and the runloop never notices.\r\n\r\nYou can make it drop events on any other queue just by varying the number of promises you resolve in between the time you first trigger an autorun and the time you schedule your doomed event.\r\n\r\nI published a working example of the bug here: https://github.com/ef4/bug-repro/tree/bad-timing\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16292","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16292/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16292/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16292/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16292","id":300192330,"number":16292,"title":"observers don't trigger in complex app","user":{"login":"BryanCrotaz","id":2016523,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2016523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCrotaz","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCrotaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCrotaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCrotaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCrotaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCrotaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCrotaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCrotaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCrotaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCrotaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCrotaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":37,"created_at":"2018-02-26T10:55:28Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T05:48:23Z","closed_at":"2018-02-27T11:49:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK, this is really weird.
