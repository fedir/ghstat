It looks like it currently points to dpldocs.info, which in the case of dxml looks terrible because I actually went to the effort of properly defining link macros and the like in the documentation, which then of course aren't recognized by the tool being used. As such, I don't want there to be a link to http://dxml.dpldocs.info/dxml.html on the [code.dlang.org page for dxml](https://code.dlang.org/packages/dxml). I already have a link to the properly generated documentation in the readme that gets displayed. As such, I would like to either be able to get rid of the Documentation tab or point it to the proper documentation. The dpldocs bit may be great for a project that didn't bother to go to the effort of putting together nice documentation, but any project that actually really uses ddoc is going to look terrible with it. And now, because that Documentation tab is on the top in big letters, folks are more likely to click on it and see the badly generated documentation instead of the official documentation.\r\n\r\nSo, _please_ make it possible to at least configure what that Documentation tab points to.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0}]}
