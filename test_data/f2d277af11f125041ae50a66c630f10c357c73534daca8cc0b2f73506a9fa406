Here's a screenshot of the UI to demonstrate the complexity:\r\n\r\n![uiview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6818777/36864028-78174b9c-1d59-11e8-9c87-f5b1611de12d.png)\r\n\r\nThere's a bit more surrounding this part of the UI, but my problem is limited to a very specific function: when you click an item on the left, the clicked item is bound to a 'selectedItem' observable which the component on the right renders.  Here's a wireframe of the structure:\r\n\r\n![wireframe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6818777/36864105-b0cf1870-1d59-11e8-855b-df57cc8bf172.png)\r\n\r\nThe IndexRule param is a top level paramater that references the overal view model, and the InclusionRule parameter is the specific item that is selected. (selectedInclusionRule is an observable).\r\n\r\nThe problem is: when clicking between one of the items on the left and the other. a huge lag spike occurs (about 8-10 seconds) which should amount to just a small DOM replacement of the rendered component (which should be sub-second).  The overall model is actually quite large: about 2.3MB of JSON text.  And the UI is responsive when the overall view model is small (I have another example of a 28kb JSON object where the UI is responsive).  One source of the lag could be the overall number of observables alive at the time.  However, for this specific use-case, clicking on a selected item and rendering the item in a component shouldn't lead to any additional notifications to any subscribed observables, so I'm very confused as to what is happening here.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know what people would do to diagnose this type of issue.  I attempted to crack open the Chrome DevTools and take a profile after loading the model, and then profiled clicking one item, 2 second break, and then clicking the second item.  This is the performance report I got:\r\n![profileview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6818777/36864504-da99b6a0-1d5a-11e8-8160-8f91b142f2dd.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there's a very large rise in listeners, JS heap and nodes that rises very fast, and then suddenly drops off.  About 1/3 of the total time here is spent in a GC collection and DOM collection.  But, what I can't understand is:  the 'item renderer component' that renders the selected item is just a very small box on the screen: maybe 20 UI elements, maybe a hundered DOM elements under the covers?  But the profile is showing a huge amount of allocations and then cleanup.\r\n\r\nI can only imagine I'm doing something wrong with components or there is some other problem in my approach.  For full disclosure: the UI depends on bootstrap functionality, I am leveraging some custom data bindings from jqueryui and knockout.sortable.  I am showing you screenshots running off of the 3.5 beta, but I get the exact same result on 3.4.2 (which is what our internal production environment is..I was hoping something in 3.5 would optimize this like component HTML based on a static string doesn't get reparsed every time, but it didn't help).\r\n\r\n@SteveSanderson , @mbest , @rniemeyer , @brianmhunt : if you have any techniques for tracing through the code or setting up certain watches to understand how components might be destroyed/reloaded, I'd very much appreciate your insight.\r\n\r\nAlso: I'm working on setting up a 'live' demo of this behavior once I get a website provisioned and configured, so I will post a link to a real-world demonstration of the issue once it becomes available.\r\n\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2352","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2352/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2352/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2352/events","html_url":"https://github.com/knockout/knockout/issues/2352","id":297799543,"number":2352,"title":"Nesting option element under an if binding causes wrong behavior","user":{"login":"HeyJude1","id":30159171,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/30159171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeyJude1","html_url":"https://github.com/HeyJude1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeyJude1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeyJude1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeyJude1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeyJude1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeyJude1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeyJude1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeyJude1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeyJude1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeyJude1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2018-02-16T14:19:01Z","updated_at":"2018-02-22T19:03:22Z","closed_at":"2018-02-22T19:03:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a `<select>` element bounded to some value, and an `<option>` element (bounded also to some value) nested under two bindings levels: a `foreach-binding` and an `if-binding`.\r\nThe behavior I get is that when selecting an option, it doesn't get rendered, but the underlying observable is correctly updated.\r\nCode ([fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/HeyJude/wbb5258q/44/)):\r\nJS:\r\n```\r\nvar DogHouseViewModel = function() {\r\n    var self = this;\r\n    self.allowedNames = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"];\r\n    self.puppies = ko.observableArray([]);\r\n    self.createPuppy = function () {\r\n  \t   self.puppies.push(new DogViewModel());\r\n    }\r\n    self.isNameAlreadyTaken = function (puppyName) {\r\n      self.puppies().forEach(function (puppy) {\r\n        if (puppy.dogName() == puppyName) {\r\n          return true;\r\n        }\r\n        return false;\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n    self.printPuppiesName = function () {\r\n  \t  self.puppies().forEach(function (puppy) {\r\n    \t  alert(puppy.dogName())\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n} \r\nvar DogViewModel = function (dogName) {\r\n   var self = this;\r\n   self.dogName = ko.observable();\r\n}\r\n\r\nvm = new DogHouseViewModel()\r\nko.applyBindings(vm);\r\n```\r\nHTML:\r\n```\r\n<div>  \r\n   <button data-bind=\"text: 'create a puppy', click: createPuppy\"></button>\r\n   <button data-bind=\"text: 'print puppies names', click: printPuppiesName\"></button>\r\n   <div data-bind=\"foreach: puppies\">\r\n      <select data-bind=\"value: dogName\">\r\n         <!-- ko foreach: $parent.allowedNames -->\r\n            <!-- ko if: !($root.isNameAlreadyTaken($data)) -->\r\n               <option data-bind=\"value: $data, text: $data\"></option> \r\n            <!-- /ko -->\r\n         <!-- /ko -->\r\n      </select>\r\n   </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2351","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2351/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2351/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2351/events","html_url":"https://

These are mostly default behaviors that should be applied to all forms in my application. Example:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n$('input:text').focus(function ()\r\n    {\r\n        $(this).select();\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight before applying knockout binding, I can check my dom elements and all events are there:\r\n\r\n[before knockout binding]( https://i.stack.imgur.com/TFvtJ.png)\r\n\r\nBut when I run the applyBindings method to bind the viewmodel to my DOM, the [\"with\" binding](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/with-binding.html) removes all events that are not related to knockout:\r\n\r\n[after knockout biding]( https://i.stack.imgur.com/NgxlB.png)\r\n\r\nI have tried overwriting the **cleanExternalData** as explained on the [documentation](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/custom-bindings-disposal.html#overriding-the-clean-up-of-external-data) and on [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31009412/1715160). But that did not help with this, the function is replaced, but the events are still removed from the DOM when the templating is applied on the binding process.\r\n\r\nFor the record, this is not an exclusive behavior of the *with* function, but all anonymous templating functions also do that, _foreach_, _if_, _ifnot_. Using *template*, as expected, also behaves the same way. The DOM element is completely destroyed, stored as a template, then added again on my document when the condition is satisfied, but now without any jquery event handlers.\r\n\r\nHow to avoid that knockout removes the events from my DOM elements?","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2313","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2313/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2313/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knockout/knockout/issues/2313/events","html_url":"https://github.com/knockout/knockout/issues/2313","id":268886455,"number":2313,"title":"Knockout js creating memory leak when used with signal r ","user":{"login":"phani257","id":25534790,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/25534790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phani257","html_url":"https://github.com/phani257","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phani257/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phani257/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phani257/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phani257/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phani257/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phani257/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phani257/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phani257/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phani257/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-10-26T19:41:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T13:44:52Z","closed_at":"2017-10-27T13:44:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Below is my source code for reconnection if the connection to the hub is lost.
