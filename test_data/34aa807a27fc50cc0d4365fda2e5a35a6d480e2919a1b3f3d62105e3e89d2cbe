The alternative [https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files](url) is not as an elegant solution for grids as this one is.\r\n\r\nIt is so popular that It has already been forked many times to replace the older coffescript dependency, like done here [https://github.com/brucejo75/meteor-file-collection](url) and here with an non-coffee version [https://github.com/swiftcourt/meteor-file-collection](url).\r\n\r\nThe other problem is its incompatibility with SSL mongo servers, which is an impediment for using Mongo Atlas, for instance, as detailed here [https://forums.meteor.com/t/issues-migrating-from-mlab-to-atlas/54206](url)  that were supposedly solved here [https://github.com/sakeena12/meteor-file-collection](url). \r\n  \r\n ##

The behavior can be observed on around 20% of the initial load of the meteor application in this instance. We do not see any server of client side errors.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is, that for the method 'login' never the update event is send via the websocket. And therefore `dataVisible` is never called in the `MethodInvoker`.\r\n\r\nFrom our understanding so far it seems that in `livedata_server.js` in the `ddp-server` package the fence is never committed and therefore the `onAllCommitted` is never executed (see https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/ab0affe98bb917d26338d96d1ea3520a6dc5cbff/packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js#L655).\r\n\r\nFrom our understanding this happens when there are still  outstanding_writes. But why this behavior can occur is unclear to us. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has suggestion how to figure out the root cause of this problem this would be very helpful. If interested we could show you the behavior on this instance via zoom. \r\n\r\nHere the log of the messages send via the websocket:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\no | 1 | 14:09:10.827\r\n-- | -- |

I tried to start Reaction Commerce and faced a host of issues, from out-of-date documentation (is the CLI deprecated? If so, why is it still prominent in the docs?) to the complexity in launching it without Docker, and finally using Docker (with some pain) to eventually giving up as the road is steep, and going with Magento. \r\n\r\nI mention that I am a senior developer so you know that if I am facing this, many others are silently walking away as it's too hard to launch it and test.\r\n\r\nHere is my question:\r\nWhy the complex microservice approach? Why not do everything in Meteor in one-place. It supports oAuth (I know as I have personally coded Google, MS, Zoom and Dropbox integration) and you can easily make it into a ID provider. The Admin UI can also be launched from Meteor itself.\r\n\r\nA single app that is easy to launch that includes everything. This will cut your own development cost by more than half as you no longer have all this glue and documentation to hold this fragile infrastructure together.\r\n\r\nThis is really too bad, looks likes a good project.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/tutorials/issues/210","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/tutorials","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/tutorials/issues/210/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/tutorials/issues/210/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/tutorials/issues/210/events","html_url":"https://github.com/meteor/tutorials/issues/210","id":676344103,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NzYzNDQxMDM=","number":210,"title":"React Tutorial Step 7 missing steps","user":{"login":"william-r-s","id":3606376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDYzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3606376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-r-s","html_url":"https://github.com/william-r-s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-r-s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-r-s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-r-s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-r-s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-r-s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-r-s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-r-s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-r-s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-r-s/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-08-10T18:53:46Z","updated_at":"2020-09-17T22:05:57Z","closed_at":"2020-09-17T22:05:57Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"The react tutorial step 7 is missing several steps needed to switch the app to using meteor methods on the client side using Meteor.call\r\nhttps://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/publish-and-subscribe\r\n\r\nLooks like the code for the missing steps is in the following commits:\r\nhttps://github.com/meteor/simple-todos-react/commit/fcbc3d45129ac89b7f8d1ee6f26afd39ddb40627\r\nhttps://github.com/meteor/simple-todos-react/commit/3221bda8001ba4aa18d5768998b6fe2cd2bf6042\r\nhttps://github.com/meteor/simple-todos-react/commit/b19f696e1a27567ef231568b92db53cf3a2247d9","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/11195","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/11195/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/11195/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/meteor/meteor/issues/11195/events","html_url":"https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/11195","id":713782258,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MTM3ODIyNTg=","number":11195,"title":"HTTP.call content type validation","user":{"login":"Sikhi","id":58640158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjQwMTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/58640158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sikhi","html_url":"https://github.com/Sikhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sikhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sikhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sikhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sikhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sikhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sikhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sikhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sikhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sikhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-10-02T17:24:01Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T09:00:57Z","closed_at":"2020-11-04T09:00:44Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/7427525de2d0b6b68e3b73d50e885c396c291fd1/packages/http/httpcall_server.js#L42\r\n\r\nPls make content type validation. without validation in some cases we can throw ugly error from vault, like errors bellow.\r\nIt happened when put object in content, not in params with POST request.\r\n>req.grant_type = \"authorization_code\";\r\n>req.client_id = \"someid\";\r\n\r\n> HTTP.post(endpoint, {\r\n>        content: req,\r\n>        headers: _headers\r\n>    }, callback);\r\n\r\nThrow error:\r\n>W20201002-19:15:48.934(3)?
