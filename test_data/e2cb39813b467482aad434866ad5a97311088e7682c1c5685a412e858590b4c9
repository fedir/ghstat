So for example the Grid: It is a table with many child elements, but these elements are added and controlled by the Grid itself, not the user of Grid, so she can't do like this:\n\n``` kotlin\nGrid {...\n   div {...} // It is prohibited for 'ParentComponents'\n}\n```\n\nI think then that the name 'ParentComponent' is misleading.\nIn my opinion, we need only two base classes: \n- abstract Component class with the protected helper methods of ParentComponent.\n  The classes that now are inherited from ParentComponent, would be the child of this Component.\n  These child classes can control which elements can a user add to themselves.\n- HTMLParentComponent, but with an another name, e.g. \"ComponentContainer\", which for the user can freely add any elements (div, ul, etc.)\n\n```\nCan you use 4 spaces as indent?\n```\n\nOf course.\n\n```\nWas thinking about adding id and class as optional parameters to all HTML DSL functions, namely HTMLParentComponent.div an .span.\nSo that instead of \ndiv {\nid = \"bla\"\nul { }\n}\nwe can write \ndiv(id=\"bla\") {\nul { }\n}\n```\n\nI think it is a good Idead, but the default value should be an empty
