(not sure about other drivers).\r\n\r\nNow it's creating a `PendingDispatch` object, which only dispatches the job on `__destruct` (https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.6/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Bus/PendingDispatch.php#L110-L113), so no way for getting the `id` from the `jobs` table using this helper anymore.\r\n\r\nI thought about adding a way for early dispatching it, something like:\r\n\r\n`src/Illuminate/Foundation/Bus/PendingDispatch.php`\r\n\r\n````php\r\n    /**\r\n     * Dispatches the job.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return mixed\r\n     */\r\n    public function dispatch()\r\n    {\r\n        if (! $this->dispatched) {\r\n            $this->dispatched = true;\r\n\r\n            return app(Dispatcher::class)->dispatch($this->job);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Handle the object's destruction.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return void\r\n     */\r\n    public function __destruct()\r\n    {\r\n        $this->dispatch();\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n\r\nBut not sure it's a good solution... for now i'm going to call `app(Dispatcher::class)->dispatch($job)` directly on my code.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be add a second param here: https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.6/src/Illuminate/Foundation/helpers.php#L381-L385\r\n\r\nLike, `$pending = true`, or something like that.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23861","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23861/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23861/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23861/events","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/23861","id":313710682,"number":23861,"title":"Cannot

Laravel Version: 5.6.14\r\n- PHP Version: 7.2.3-1\r\n- Database Driver & Version: MariaDB-10.2.13\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\nsignedRoute, a great addition to Laravel IMHO, uses named routes to generate URL's with the signature and optional expiration. \r\n\r\nThe pagination template uses plain URL's and doesn't seem to take named routes into consideration when generating the URL's for additional pages.\r\n\r\nThere does not seem to be an obvious or easy way to use pagination with signedRoutes. \r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAdded the following to `app/Kernel.php`\r\n```\r\n    protected $routeMiddleware = [\r\n        'signed' => \\Illuminate\\Routing\\Middleware\\ValidateSignature::class,\r\n    ];\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdded to

}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is that someone can click on the link to the article index from the home page and successfully access that paginated results. However, clicking any of the pagination links results in a `\\Illuminate\\Routing\\Exceptions\\InvalidSignatureException` exception since the pagination link template doesn't handle signature generation properly.

However it seems that the scheduler didn't use the app's config timezone and defaulted to something else. I had to add the timezone method to each task to get it working - seems like a bug to me as the scheduler should default to the app config?","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23758","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23758/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23758/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23758/events","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/23758","id":310217861,"number":23758,"title":"Route parameters makes singular problems in resources route","user":{"login":"hirenkeraliya","id":22992703,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22992703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirenkeraliya","html_url":"https://github.com/hirenkeraliya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirenkeraliya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirenkeraliya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirenkeraliya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirenkeraliya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirenkeraliya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirenkeraliya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirenkeraliya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirenkeraliya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirenkeraliya/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-03-31T06:45:41Z","updated_at":"2018-04-05T14:39:19Z","closed_at":"2018-04-05T14:39:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In the Resources route can not work parameter of the route for edit, update and delete In my case that's given below.\r\n\r\n`Route::resource('perus', 'PeruController');`\r\n\r\nThis perus name has been generated by facker factory.\r\n\r\nThat shuld be return parameter peru but that return parameter perus\r\n![screenshot from 2018-03-31 12-10-19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22992703/38160515-1c9eefae-34dd-11e8-846c-a453ceb61228.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","score":1.0}]}
