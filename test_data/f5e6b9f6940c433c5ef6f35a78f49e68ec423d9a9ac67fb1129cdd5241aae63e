Create two models.\r\n    SampleModel.php, SampleRelatedModel.php\r\n\r\n2. Create relationship in SampleModel.php\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    public function relatedModels()\r\n    {\r\n        return $this->hasMany(SampleRelatedModel::class);\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Create an \"accessor-like\" method for relatedModels in SampleModel.php\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    public function getRelatedModels()\r\n    {\r\n        return \"Sample Method\";\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Test the methods\r\n\r\n- Call `$sampleModel->relatedModels;`. This will return a collection of `SampleRelatedModel`s related to it.\r\n\r\n- Call `$sampleModel->getRelatedModels()`. This will return `\"Sample Method\"` string.\r\n\r\n- Now, interpolate the previous call. `\"$sampleModel->getRelatedModels()\"`.\r\n  - This will cause an error saying: method `getRelatedModels` should return a relationship.\r\n\r\nI've traced the method calls, it seems to me that the interpolated call triggered the magic `__get` method of the model.\r\n\r\nThis is the result of what I've traced.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Model.php\r\npublic function __get($key)\r\n{\r\n    return $this->getAttribute($key);\r\n}\r\n// |\r\n// V\r\n// HasAttributes.php\r\npublic function getAttribute($key)\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n    return $this->getRelationValue($key);\r\n}\r\n// |\r\n// V\r\n// HasAttributes.php\r\npublic function getRelationValue($key)\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n    if (method_exists($this, $key)) {\r\n        return $this->getRelationshipFromMethod($key);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n// |\r\n// V\r\n// HasAttributes.php\r\nprotected function getRelationshipFromMethod($method)\r\n{\r\n    $relation = $this->$method(); // <-- lastly to this\r\n    // $method = \"getRelatedModels\"\r\n    if (! $relation instanceof Relation) {\r\n        throw new LogicException(sprintf(\r\n            '%s::%s must return a relationship instance.', static::class, $method\r\n        ));\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this bug is PHP-specific or Laravel-specific.

current($tmp) : '';`\r\n`if (empty($subdomain) || realpath(__DIR__ . \"/../.{$subdomain}.env\") === false) {`\r\n`    die(\"Sorry, I think you are at wrong place, you shouldn't be here :).\");`\r\n`}`\r\n`$app->loadEnvironmentFrom(\".{$subdomain}.env\");`\r\n`$response = $kernel->handle($request)`\r\n`$response->send();`\r\n`$kernel->terminate($request, $response);`\r\n\r\nhere, I have empty .env file which will not have any content inside because i don't want any default environment setup. i want subdomain specific settings for the application which will have different db, email & other settings that's why i have different .[subdomain].env files for each subdomains.\r\n\r\nI have tried to see the loaded application setting which will show the correct env file loaded but the values are referenced from the old env which was loaded on the last request so, i thought `loadEnvironmentFrom` is not working as expected to work.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce:\r\n1. Install the laravel using installer or any other method\r\n2. setup multiple subdomains on your system and their env files with different setting for databases.\r\n3. write above code in `index.php` at the end of the file before processing the request.\r\n4. then try to load the database connections or any other config using the `config('app')`.\r\n5. you will see that old values are loading.\r\n\r\nthanks in

Laravel Version 5.3 and sometimes when a user uploads a file, it fails with this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproduction.ERROR: Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\File\\Exception\\FileNotFoundException: The file \"\" does not exist in /home/app/vendor/symfony/http-foundation/File/MimeType/MimeTypeGuesser.php:123\r\nStack trace:\r\n```\r\nThis error does not happen all the time and it only happens in some uploads. I notice these errors in my laravel logs.\r\n\r\nThe file is uploaded via Ajax (Angular) and the Laravel Controller that handles that POST, uses `getMimeType()` like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$postData = $request->only('file');\r\n$file = $postData['file'];\r\nif (empty($file)) {\r\n       return response()->json(['error' => 'file not found.'], 400);\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n       $mime = $file->getMimeType();\r\n       ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is interesting is, the code does not fail in `if (empty($file))` case if the file was really empty. But it only fails when it comes to `$file->getMimeType()` line with the above error message.\r\n\r\nI have already searched the issues here and found couple of discussions like: https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/12350\r\n\r\nI am still not sure what the solution here is. I don't want to upgrade Laravel to 5.6 yet and I dont want to edit the main application files inside `laravel/framework/src/` unless there is no other choice. Can someone help me understand what maybe the cause for this issue and how can I resolve this in Laravel 5.3?\r\n\r\n\r\n","score":1.0}]}
