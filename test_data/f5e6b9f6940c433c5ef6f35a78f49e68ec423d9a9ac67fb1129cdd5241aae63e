Navigate to the homepage and you'll have a fresh, logged in session and remember cookie will still exist.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23813","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23813/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23813/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23813/events","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/23813","id":311638877,"number":23813,"title":"Serializing an Eloquent model to a JSON response not applying Carbon::serializeUsing","user":{"login":"luizpinheiro","id":6372797,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6372797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luizpinheiro","html_url":"https://github.com/luizpinheiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luizpinheiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luizpinheiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luizpinheiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luizpinheiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luizpinheiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luizpinheiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luizpinheiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luizpinheiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luizpinheiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-05T14:40:11Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T12:37:24Z","closed_at":"2018-04-06T12:37:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- Laravel Version: 5.6.15\r\n- PHP Version: 7.2\r\n- Database Driver & Version: 5.6\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\nIn the docs for [Eloquent date serialization](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/eloquent-serialization#date-serialization) we have:\r\n\r\n>To customize how all Carbon dates throughout your application are serialized, use the Carbon::serializeUsing method.\r\n\r\nWhen sending an Eloquent model in a JSON response, and having the follow code in the AppServiceProvider (just like in the snippet in the docs), Eloquent completly ignores the defined serialization format for dates.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n//AppServiceProvider\r\npublic function boot()\r\n{\r\n        Carbon::serializeUsing(function ($carbon) {\r\n            return $carbon->toIso8601String();\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe response is writen like:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n//Controller\r\nfunction getCompanyData(Request $request) {\r\n\r\n    $company = Company::find(1);\r\n\r\n    return response()->json(['success' => 1, 'data' => $company]);\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n//model\r\nclass Company extends Model\r\n{\r\n    protected $dates = ['created_at', 'updated_at', 'deleted_at'];\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the result is:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n    \"success\": 1,\r\n    \"data\": {\r\n        \"id\": 1,\r\n        \"name\": \"Test Company\",\r\n        \"cash_balance\": \"0.00\",\r\n        \"bank_balance\": \"600.69\",\r\n        \"logo_image_name\": \"ih/5iqqmvfdtq4txyfj71clxurakiaakcogw4kt0jwfckc4hjlnw\",\r\n        \"created_at\": \"2018-04-01 22:38:01\", /* Not the ISO format!

Laravel Version: 5.6.14\r\n- PHP Version: 7.2.3-1\r\n- Database Driver & Version: MariaDB-10.2.13\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\nsignedRoute, a great addition to Laravel IMHO, uses named routes to generate URL's with the signature and optional expiration. \r\n\r\nThe pagination template uses plain URL's and doesn't seem to take named routes into consideration when generating the URL's for additional pages.\r\n\r\nThere does not seem to be an obvious or easy way to use pagination with signedRoutes. \r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAdded the following to `app/Kernel.php`\r\n```\r\n    protected $routeMiddleware = [\r\n        'signed' => \\Illuminate\\Routing\\Middleware\\ValidateSignature::class,\r\n    ];\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdded to `routes/web.php`\r\n```\r\n\tRoute::middleware(['signed'])->group(function () {\r\n\t\tRoute::resource('articles', 'ArticleController');\r\n\t});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdded to `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`\r\n```\r\n<a href=\"{{ url()->signedRoute('article.index') }}\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nPartial contents of `app/Http/Controllers/ArticleController.php`\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * Display a listing of the resource.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return \\Illuminate\\Http\\Response\r\n     */\r\n    public function index()\r\n    {\r\n        $articles = Article::with('comments')->paginate(20);\r\n        return view('article.index', ['articles' => $articles]);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPartial contents of `resources/views/article/index.blade.php`\r\n```\r\n@foreach ($articles as $article)\r\n<h1>{{ $article->name }}</h1>\r\n<p>{{ $article->summary}}</p>\r\n@endforeach\r\n\r\n{{ $articles->links() }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is that someone can click on the link to the article index from the home page and successfully access that paginated results. However, clicking any of the pagination links results in a `\\Illuminate\\Routing\\Exceptions\\InvalidSignatureException` exception since the pagination link template doesn't handle signature generation properly.

The alternative is to keep the check and pass the correct arguments, but then we would require a pointless `$value` argument to be passed to `put($key, $value, $minutes)` to even use it as intended in which case the developer is better off just calling `putMany($values, $minutes)` directly themselves.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23728","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23728/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23728/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23728/events","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/23728","id":309429985,"number":23728,"title":"Command and job not executing completely","user":{"login":"jfelipeara","id":10985977,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10985977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfelipeara","html_url":"https://github.com/jfelipeara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfelipeara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfelipeara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfelipeara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfelipeara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfelipeara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfelipeara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfelipeara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfelipeara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfelipeara/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-03-28T15:59:47Z","updated_at":"2018-04-05T14:52:16Z","closed_at":"2018-04-05T14:52:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\nPlease use this issue tracker only for reporting Laravel bugs.\r\n\r\nIf you need support, please use the forums:\r\n\r\n- https://laracasts.com/discuss \r\n- https://laravel.io/forum\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may use Slack (https://larachat.co/) or Stack Overflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/laravel).\r\n\r\nIf you would like to propose new Laravel features, please make a pull request, or open an issue at https://github.com/laravel/internals/issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Laravel Version: 5.5\r\n- PHP Version: 7.1\r\n- Database Driver & Version: mysql 5.7\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\nI have a command that runs a scraper from some website and send a slack notification, it is a cron job and it works fine most of the times here is the code:\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n            if (!Cache::has('scraper-database')) {\r\n                Cache::forever('scraper', 'proccesing');\r\n                $lines = shell_exec('node /home/jfelipeara/htdocs/administrator/resources/assets/js/scraper/index.js');\r\n                $sims = json_decode($lines, true);\r\n                $verifier = new BalanceVerifier($sims);\r\n                $verifier->verify();\r\n                Cache::forget('scraper');\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (Exception $e) {\r\n            Cache::forget('scraper');\r\n            Log::error('Scraper catch an exception: ' . $e->getMessage());\r\n            Log::error('trace: ' . $e->getTraceAsString());\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nwhen i run the command manually it works fine, when i use schedule it works fine, but some times the cache key doesn't delete and it doesn't catch any error and i have to clear it  manually so it run again next time.
