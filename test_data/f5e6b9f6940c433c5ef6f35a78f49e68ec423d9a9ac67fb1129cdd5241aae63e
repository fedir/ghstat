does not allow access to $parameters which makes it very limited.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce:\r\nCreate a custom validation rule such as this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n        // Usage Example: ['required|decimal:4,2']\r\n        Validator::extend('decimal', function ($attribute, $value, $parameters, $validator) {\r\n            $number = (int)$parameters[0];\r\n            $decimals = (int)$parameters[1];\r\n\r\n            // E.g: /^[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,2}$/\r\n            // If the decimal format is 3,2\r\n            return preg_match(\"/^[0-9]{1,$number}.[0-9]{1,$decimals}$/\", $value);\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to refactor this into its own class you can't because the $parameters are not sent to the passes() method on the custom rule.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n     /**\r\n     * Determine if the validation rule passes.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param  string  $attribute\r\n     * @param  mixed  $value\r\n     * @return bool\r\n     */\r\n    public function passes($attribute, $value)\r\n    {\r\n        //\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Simple Solution:\r\nIt appears trivial to add this in:\r\n\r\n4th Parameter here: https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4b736f75f533e53f677dff52efd80fa5088a39b6/src/Illuminate/Validation/Validator.php#L359\r\n\r\n```php\r\n        if ($rule instanceof RuleContract) {\r\n            return $validatable\r\n//                  ? $this->validateUsingCustomRule($attribute, $value, $rule)\r\n                    ? $this->validateUsingCustomRule($attribute, $value, $rule, $parameters)\r\n                    : null;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here:\r\nhttps://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4b736f75f533e53f677dff52efd80fa5088a39b6/src/Illuminate/Validation/Validator.php#L537\r\n\r\n```php\r\n//      protected function validateUsingCustomRule($attribute, $value, $rule)\r\n        protected function validateUsingCustomRule($attribute, $value, $rule, $parameters)\r\n    {\r\n//      if (! $rule->passes($attribute, $value)) {\r\n        if (! $rule->passes($attribute, $value, $parameters)) {\r\n            $this->failedRules[$attribute][get_class($rule)] = [];\r\n\r\n            $this->messages->add($attribute, $this->makeReplacements(\r\n                $rule->message(), $attribute, get_class($rule), []\r\n            ));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could also make it the same as the extension based approach by sending the validator as the 4th parameter.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n//      if (! $rule->passes($attribute, $value)) {\r\n        if (! $rule->passes($attribute, $value, $parameters, $this)) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy to try and submit a PR is this is

when I do so, I can only get good results from the $req query because the query that has been \"unioned\", return different results that the ones returned by phpMyAdmin.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do
