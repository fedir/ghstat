Create two models.\r\n    SampleModel.php, SampleRelatedModel.php\r\n\r\n2. Create relationship in SampleModel.php\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    public function relatedModels()\r\n    {\r\n        return $this->hasMany(SampleRelatedModel::class);\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3.

Test the methods\r\n\r\n- Call `$sampleModel->relatedModels;`. This will return a collection of `SampleRelatedModel`s related to it.\r\n\r\n- Call `$sampleModel->getRelatedModels()`. This will return `\"Sample Method\"` string.\r\n\r\n- Now, interpolate the previous call. `\"$sampleModel->getRelatedModels()\"`.\r\n  - This will cause an error saying: method `getRelatedModels` should return a relationship.\r\n\r\nI've traced the method calls, it seems to me that the interpolated call triggered the magic `__get` method of the model.\r\n\r\nThis is the result of what I've traced.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Model.php\r\npublic function __get($key)\r\n{\r\n    return $this->getAttribute($key);\r\n}\r\n// |\r\n// V\r\n// HasAttributes.php\r\npublic function getAttribute($key)\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n    return $this->getRelationValue($key);\r\n}\r\n// |\r\n// V\r\n// HasAttributes.php\r\npublic function getRelationValue($key)\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n    if (method_exists($this, $key)) {\r\n        return $this->getRelationshipFromMethod($key);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n// |\r\n// V\r\n// HasAttributes.php\r\nprotected function getRelationshipFromMethod($method)\r\n{\r\n    $relation = $this->$method(); // <-- lastly to this\r\n    // $method = \"getRelatedModels\"\r\n    if (! $relation instanceof Relation) {\r\n        throw new LogicException(sprintf(\r\n            '%s::%s must return a relationship instance.', static::class, $method\r\n        ));\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this bug is PHP-specific or Laravel-specific.

But first, I'd like to see what you guys think of the idea. Maybe it's simply too much for just some silly numbers? Maybe it'll add to the load time?\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear your oppinions on this.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23574","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23574/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23574/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23574/events","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/23574","id":305964200,"number":23574,"title":"Validation on Date passes invalid dates","user":{"login":"joveice","id":14098624,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14098624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joveice","html_url":"https://github.com/joveice","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joveice/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joveice/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joveice/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joveice/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joveice/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joveice/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joveice/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joveice/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joveice/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-03-16T15:07:58Z","updated_at":"2018-03-18T19:41:25Z","closed_at":"2018-03-18T19:41:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- Laravel Version: 5.6.3\r\n- PHP Version: 7.2.2-3 / 7.1.7\r\n- Database Driver & Version: MariaDB 10.2.6\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\nValidation date passes invalid dates\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce:\r\n```\r\nValidator::make($data,\r\n            [\r\n                'date' => 'required|date',\r\n            ]\r\n          );\r\n```\r\n\r\ngive it a date of etc 1970-8n-10 and it passes it, and the database says nope: error 1292","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23571","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23571/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23571/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/23571/events","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/23571","id":305935167,"number":23571,"title":"Bad format for date columns in jobs table","user":{"login":"squiaios","id":13620819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13620819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squiaios","html_url":"https://github.com/squiaios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squiaios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squiaios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squiaios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squiaios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squiaios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squiaios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squiaios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squiaios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squiaios/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-03-16T13:51:20Z","updated_at":"2018-03-18T19:39:51Z","closed_at":"2018-03-18T19:39:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/d64e500037a198e804ad83d3adeee6708cf36659/src/Illuminate/Queue/Console/stubs/jobs.stub#L21\r\n\r\nis it normal that it is unsignedInteger used instead of timestamps for reserved_at, available_at and created_at columns ?","score":1.0}]}
