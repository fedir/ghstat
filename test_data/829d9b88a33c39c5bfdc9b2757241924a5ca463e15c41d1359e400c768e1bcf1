way the function getByKey in mapCache is implemented right know is not safe:\r\n\r\n    override string getByKey(string master_key,string key, lazy string v= string.init)\r\n    {\r\n        string pk = master_key ~ key;\r\n        _mutex.reader.lock();\r\n        scope(exit) _mutex.reader.unlock();\r\n        return _map.get(pk,v);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBy just concatenating the keys it is possible to access other access other keys by mistake:\r\n\r\n    getByKey(\"AA\", \"B\") == getByKey(\"A\", \"AB\");\r\n\r\nFor example this can have security consequences if the key is taken from user input even without any access to the master key part.\r\n\r\nOutside of any context the best way to concatenate them I can think of is:\r\n\r\n    override string getByKey(string master_key, string key, lazy string v=string.init)\r\n    {\r\n        string prefix = master_key.length.to!string ~ \",\";\r\n        string pk = prefix ~ master_key ~ key;\r\n        _mutex.reader.lock();\r\n        scope(exit) _mutex.reader.unlock();\r\n        return _map.get(pk,v);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt works by making the length of the master key explicit. I use a non-numerical separator to remove ambiguity in case the master_key starts with a number. Of course the setByKey function must be adapted too. That way it is not possible to be ambiguous :\r\n\r\n    getByKey(\"AA\", \"B\") -> 2,AAB\r\n    getByKey(\"A\", \"AB\") -> 1,AAB\r\n\r\nNote that in most cases you don't have to unserialize that key, the setByKey just builds its key the same way, it doesn't have to check existing the formatting of existing keys.\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huntlabs/hunt/issues/51","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huntlabs/hunt","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huntlabs/hunt/issues/51/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huntlabs/hunt/issues/51/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huntlabs/hunt/issues/51/events","html_url":"https://github.com/huntlabs/hunt/issues/51","id":188720018,"number":51,"title":"The session ID is not safe","user":{"login":"cym13","id":4958985,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4958985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cym13","html_url":"https://github.com/cym13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cym13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cym13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cym13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cym13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cym13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cym13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cym13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cym13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cym13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2016-11-11T09:34:45Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T08:19:41Z","closed_at":"2017-05-17T08:19:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The problem\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThe way the session ID as generated is unsafe :\r\n\r\n    public string generateSessionId()\r\n    {\r\n        import std.digest.sha;\r\n        import std.format;\r\n        import std.datetime;\r\n        import std.random;\r\n        import core.cpuid;\r\n        import std.string;\r\n\r\n        auto str = toHexString(sha1Of(format(\"%s--%s--%s\",\r\n            Clock.currTime().toISOExtString, uniform(long.min, long.max), processor())));\r\n\r\n        return toLower(cast(string)(str[]));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis showcases many cryptographic issues:\r\n\r\n- the current time isn't random at all and is easy to predict with a low error margin.\r\n\r\n- uniform isn't a cryptographically secured pseudo random number generator, given enough data (a few hundreds of session ids, nothing difficult to generate) it's easy to predict any further input.\r\n\r\n- the processor is not random either, it's possible to find it and once leaked it is very hard to change\r\n\r\n- sha1 is completely unsafe and should never be used.
