I believe that leaving it\nin `save` was a mistake, since that commit was intended to move the\nrollback logic from the `save`/`save!` call to the transaction stack.\n\nAs of 67d8bb963d5d51fc644d6b1ca20164efb4cee6d7 the record's original\nstate is lazily restored the first time it's accessed after the\ntransaction, instead of when a rollback occurs. This means that the call\nto `restore_transaction_record_state` here has no effect: the record's\ntransaction level is incremented twice (in rollback_active_record_state!\nand `with_transaction_returning_status`), isn't decremented again until\nthe the `ensure` block runs, and won't hit zero until the next time\n`sync_with_transaction_state` is called.","tree":{"sha":"4a8560807a0c46336001db207c96e01e27c5974d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/trees/4a8560807a0c46336001db207c96e01e27c5974d"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/48007d5390db47fc1223f57c8e7ab3ebb7c3a3d7","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/commits/48007d5390db47fc1223f57c8e7ab3ebb7c3a3d7","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/48007d5390db47fc1223f57c8e7ab3ebb7c3a3d7","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/commits/48007d5390db47fc1223f57c8e7ab3ebb7c3a3d7/comments","author":{"login":"eugeneius","id":432189,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/432189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius","html_url":"https://github.com/eugeneius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"eugeneius","id":432189,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/432189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius","html_url":"https://github.com/eugeneius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugeneius/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"6fac9bd599eeb6b9cacdf7841811223402c501bd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/commits/6fac9bd599eeb6b9cacdf7841811223402c501bd","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/6fac9bd599eeb6b9cacdf7841811223402c501bd"}]},{"sha":"6fac9bd599eeb6b9cacdf7841811223402c501bd","commit":{"author":{"name":"yuuji.yaginuma","email":"yuuji.yaginuma@gmail.com","date":"2018-05-09T09:20:54Z"},"committer":{"name":"Yuji
