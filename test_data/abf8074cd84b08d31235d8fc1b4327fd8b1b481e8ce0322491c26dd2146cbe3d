jest 26, this packages causes issues because it is not published transpiled:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Jest encountered an unexpected token\r\n\r\n    This usually means that you are trying to import a file which Jest cannot parse, e.g. it's not plain JavaScript.\r\n\r\n    By default, if Jest sees a Babel config, it will use that to transform your files, ignoring \"node_modules\".\r\n\r\n    Here's what you can do:\r\n     • If you are trying to use ECMAScript Modules, see https://jestjs.io/docs/en/ecmascript-modules for how to enable it.\r\n     • To have some of your \"node_modules\" files transformed, you can specify a custom \"transformIgnorePatterns\" in your config.\r\n     • If you need a custom transformation specify a \"transform\" option in your config.\r\n     • If you simply want to mock your non-JS modules (e.g. binary assets) you can stub them out with the \"moduleNameMapper\" config option.\r\n\r\n    You'll find more details and examples of these config options in the docs:\r\n    https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html\r\n\r\n    Details:\r\n\r\n    /home/user/code/project/node_modules/angular-server-side-configuration/ng-env.js:6\r\n    export var NG_ENV =

Setting the `transformIgnorePatterns` option in the config doesn't solve anything.\r\n\r\nUsing this jest.config.ts file:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n/*\r\n * override default tsConfig setting of

🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/cli:

\"@angular/cli\": \"^10.2.0\",\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAngular 11's `angular.json` no longer allows fileReplacements with .html files, as the @angular/cli schema says .html files are invalid. `ng build --prod` also errors when trying to run with html in fileReplacements\r\n\r\nangular.json\r\n```\r\n...\r\n      \"configurations\": {\r\n            \"production\": {\r\n

one schema in oneOf.\r\n```\r\n\r\nvscode also gives a linting warning with `String does not match the pattern of \"\\.([cm]?j|t)sx?$\".` for the two .html lines.\r\n\r\n### Expectation\r\nExpect that `.html` fileReplacements replacements are allowed, since it is useful to have different meta tags and other analytics scripts stored in the `index.html` file for different build configurations.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nExample repo here: https://github.com/ChristopherHoffman/Angular11-Html-File-Replacement-Broken/tags\r\n\r\nTag \"Working\" is a fresh app using the Angular 10 cli, with just a `index.prod.html` to the angular.json's production configuration. `ng build --prod` works as expected. \r\n\r\nTag \"Broken\" is just after updating to Angular 11, and `ng build --prod` no longer works because of that `.html`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n> ng build --prod\r\n\r\nSchema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path

port which is always switching from `NaN`  to the desired value given by the device mapped.

directly or from a `CommandDispatcher` (which, in turn, has the `DeviceMapper`  as an input).\r\n\r\nIs this, somehow, an expected

This was brought to our attention through https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/22421\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/mhartington/ng-wc-component-factory-issue\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nNo exception or error is thrown\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 10.2.0\r\nNode: 14.11.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.2.1\r\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1002.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1002.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.0.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      10.0.8\r\n@angular/cli                    10.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             10.0.8\r\n@schematics/update              0.1002.0\r\nrxjs                            6.5.5\r\ntypescript                      3.9.7\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that in the example, we have \r\n\r\n```\r\n<ion-content> <! -- web component -->\r\n  <button (click)=\"add()\">Add</button>\r\n  <div #target></div>\r\n</ion-content>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the `#target` is changed to a `ng-template` or the `ion-content` is removed, the issue does not happen.

Description\r\nLazy loading does not work with feature modules exported from the same library project. Any additions to the feature module result in increase in main.js bundle size, instead of the lazy loaded feature module.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nClone this repo: https://github.com/jonathanlie/repro-lazy-loading-issue\r\n\r\n1. `npm install`\r\n2. Run `ng build some-lib --watch` on a tab\r\n3. Run `ng serve some-app` on a separate tab after\r\n4. Verify app is working on `localhost:4200`\r\n5. Remove / add content to `listing.component.scss` in `projects/some-lib/src/lib/lazy/components/listing/listing.component.scss`, and what happens is that the main.js bundle size is the one reduced instead.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuild at: 2020-11-13T06:22:30.373Z - Hash: c12a866456896e242a74 - Time: 2012ms\r\n\r\n✔ Compiled successfully.\r\n✔ Browser application bundle generation

The issue Started happening when I updated the client app that uses this library, I had to update it to Angular 11 as well, all went ok, but after I tried to run it, it started spitting those `Duplicated Identifier` errors.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought the issue was my project, that maybe I screwed something up on the update process, so I created a clean \r\nnew project, just imported my library and did a minimum setup to get it running and right away the same errors appeared.\r\n\r\nI pasted the snippets of the errors happening bellow.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/joaodforce/angular-11-test\r\nI made this simple project that install my Angular Library and imports its module, Simply `npm install` it and `npm start` it, the issue will appear.\r\nConsidering the Lib Itself builds and runs fine on its own I'm pretty confident the issue is related with the compiler on the client Application.\r\n\r\nThere will also be some errors related to some `strings.json` files, but those are unrelated to the matter at hand.\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nstatic ɵfac: ɵngcc0.ɵɵFactoryDef<TableBuiderComponent, never>;\r\n              ~~~~\r\nnode_modules/fre-base-components/lib/dynamic-base-builder/dynamic-base-builder.component.d.ts:37:12 - error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'ɵfac'.\r\n\r\n37     static ɵfac: ɵngcc0.ɵɵFactoryDef<BaseBuiderComponent, never>;39m\r\n              ~~~~\r\nnode_modules/fre-base-components/lib/dynamic-alter-builder/dynamic-alter-builder.component.d.ts:32:12 - error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'ɵfac'.\r\n\r\n32     static ɵfac: ɵngcc0.ɵɵFactoryDef<AlterBuilderComponent, never>;\r\n              ~~~~\r\nnode_modules/fre-base-components/lib/dynamic-nav-builder/dynamic-nav-builder.component.d.ts:18:12 - error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'ɵfac'.\r\n\r\n18     static ɵfac: ɵngcc0.ɵɵFactoryDef<NavigationBuilderComponent, never>;\r\n              ~~~~\r\nnode_modules/fre-base-components/lib/dynamic-login-builder/dynamic-login-builder.component.d.ts:21:12 - error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'ɵfac'.\r\n\r\n21     static ɵfac: ɵngcc0.ɵɵFactoryDef<DynamicLoginBuilderComponent, never>;\r\n              ~~~~\r\nnode_modules/fre-base-components/lib/dynamic-report-builder/dynamic-report-builder.component.d.ts:26:12 - error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'ɵfac'.\r\n\r\n26     static ɵfac: ɵngcc0.ɵɵFactoryDef<ReportBuilderComponent, never>;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 11.0.0\r\nNode: 12.16.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, material, material-moment-adapter, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1100.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1100.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.0.0\r\n@angular/flex-layout            10.0.0-beta.32\r\n@schematics/angular             11.0.0\r\n@schematics/update              0.1100.0\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

confuses me about the `preOrderHooks` array within `TView` objects.\r\n\r\nAccording to https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3236ae0ee118d0734c90fa9f3767435396213470/packages/core/src/render3/interfaces/view.ts#L658-L665\r\n\r\neven indices are for directive indices and odd indices are for hook functions. The other hook arrays follow this exact same pattern.\r\n\r\nI noticed that in several places where the hook arrays are updated, they are always updated with the directive index and hook function simultaneously, enforcing the encoding of even indices as directive indices and odd indices as hook functions. \r\n\r\nSee\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3236ae0ee118d0734c90fa9f3767435396213470/packages/core/src/render3/hooks.ts#L40\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3236ae0ee118d0734c90fa9f3767435396213470/packages/core/src/render3/hooks.ts#L46\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3236ae0ee118d0734c90fa9f3767435396213470/packages/core/src/render3/hooks.ts#L50\r\n\r\nIn practice though this encoding is not always true for `preOrderHooks`.

When I go back and navigate to a different route, these properties are then undefined. This problem can only be replicated when the app is built in prod mode.  \r\n\r\nI am fairly new to Angular, so this could be an implementation problem rather than a bug with Scully. \r\n\r\n#### 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI have created a repo with the bug present - https://github.com/tomling/scully-app\r\n\r\nWhen running the app in prod mode, go to News -> Click one of the links. You can see the date displayed at the top of the post.\r\nThen go back to the News page, then click another post. The date now does not appear. \r\nThe only way of returning the date is by navigating back to a post and refreshing the page.\r\n\r\n#### 💻Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.7\r\nNode: 14.8.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.1.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      10.1.7\r\n@angular/cli                    10.1.7\r\n@schematics/angular             10.1.7\r\n@schematics/update              0.1001.7\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n\r\n**Scully Version:**\r\n\r\n\"@scullyio/init\": \"^1.0.1\",\r\n    \"@scullyio/ng-lib\": \"^1.0.0\",\r\n    \"@scullyio/scully\": \"^1.0.4\",\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nNo visible error\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metabase/metabase/issues/13692","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metabase/metabase","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metabase/metabase/issues/13692/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metabase/metabase/issues/13692/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metabase/metabase/issues/13692/events","html_url":"https://github.com/metabase/metabase/issues/13692","id":736612704,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzY2MTI3MDQ=","number":13692,"title":"Can I integrate Data Visualation part into my Angular app","user":{"login":"vijayakumarmariyappan","id":60595559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk1NTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/60595559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijayakumarmariyappan","html_url":"https://github.com/vijayakumarmariyappan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijayakumarmariyappan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijayakumarmariyappan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijayakumarmariyappan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijayakumarmariyappan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijayakumarmariyappan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijayakumarmariyappan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijayakumarmariyappan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijayakumarmariyappan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijayakumarmariyappan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1603949821,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjAzOTQ5ODIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metabase/metabase/labels/.Needs%20Triage","name":".Needs Triage","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":172924555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI5MjQ1NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metabase/metabase/labels/Type:Question","name":"Type:Question","color":"CEDECE","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-11-05T04:58:48Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T10:33:29Z","closed_at":"2020-11-05T10:33:29Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Data Visualizing:\r\nhttps://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/master/docs/users-guide/05-visualizing-results.md\r\n\r\nI have a Angular App, inside that I would like to integrate this data visualization part.
