reference: https://rocket.rs/guide/state/#databases\r\nThis is on the latest version of Rocket.\r\n\r\nAt present, the given example for using Rocket state within handlers(namely implementing it as a request guard) works well within those handlers, exclusively. \r\n\r\nExample attached.\r\n\r\nHowever, when attempting to access this state within other Request Guards (for example, a FromData implementation), a compile time error occurs as follows: \r\n```\r\n   = help: within `db::DbConn`, the trait `std::marker::Sync` is not implemented for `std::cell::RefCell<std::collections::HashMap<diesel::connection::StatementCacheKey<diesel::pg::Pg>, diesel::pg::connection::stmt::Statement>>`\r\n   = note: required because it appears within the

be that because non-Sqlite Connections don't automatically impl Sync, they're unable to be accessed from other Request Guard impls, despite being available as a request guard itself.\r\n\r\nThis seems to present an inconsistent API: State does _not_ need to implement Sync for Request Guards, _unless_ other Request Guards use that state. \r\n\r\nIdeally, we could relax the need for Sync when using Request Guards within other Request Guards, but this might be difficult. In the short term, updating this documentation to clarify when state is and isn't accessible (not in other request guards, unless sync is implemented) would help notify users that request guards which authenticate users via. the Db to seek another approach.

a fairly basic API example that uses Rocket_contrib to serve some JSON.  I based it off of the JSON example that you have.  I am building an app for a tutorial and I wanted to see what kinds of stuff I could potentially do before actually building the real project but when I try to build this app I get an error `no `JsonValue` in the root`.  I also get an error where it isn't finding the `catchers! macro` either.\r\n\r\nIf I try to change the JsonValue to just Value, then I get a bunch of errors about it not implementing the `rocket::response::Responder<'_>` trait.   There is a basic error swapping `catchers!` to `errors!` as well involved.  I have the `default-features = \"false\"` and the `features = [\"json\"]` parts added for the rocket_contrib dependency but that doesn't seem to fix anything.  \r\n\r\nI am running on Windows MSVC with the latest nightly build and I am using Rocket 0.3.6 for rocket, rocket_codegen and rocket_contrib in case that matters.\r\n\r\nEdit: I tried copying and pasting your JSON example and I got the same errors even after a `cargo clean && cargo build`\r\n\r\nAny ideas?
