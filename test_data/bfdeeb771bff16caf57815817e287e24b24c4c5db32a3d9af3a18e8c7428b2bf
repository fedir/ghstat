So now I had to run my program on a windows 10 machine with the build tools over visual studio 2017. This caused a compile failure with ring 0.11. It appears that it should work with ring 0.13 (tested with version 0.13.0-alpha1 and 0.13.0-alpha2).\r\n\r\nAs a test project to validate that rocket was the problem in my original program, I used the hello world example from the readme. To validate that ring 0.13 does work, i simply created a hello world project  from the rust book and added ring to the dependencies.\r\n\r\nRocket version:  \"0.3.10\"\r\nOS version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nI think that an upgrade to ring 0.13 would solve this issue.

However, part of it is very light gray, which makes it extremely hard to read against a white terminal background.\r\n\r\n    * When the bug occurs.\r\n\r\nRocket startup.\r\n\r\n    * What you expected vs. what actually happened.\r\n\r\nExpect legible text, get hard-to-read text.\r\n\r\n  4. How you uncovered the bug. Short, reproducible tests are especially useful.\r\n\r\nStarted a Rocket server.\r\n\r\n  5. Ideas, if any, about what Rocket is doing incorrectly.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if Rocket would choose a different color for the currently light-gray text.

\r\n\r\nI'm using the lastest version of rocket in my project and stumbled over a small issue:\r\n\r\nI have define a route for a POST like this:\r\n\r\n`#[post(\"/service/xxx/ep-project-blah\", format = \"application/octet-stream\", data = \"<data>\")]\r\npub fn service_endpoint_project_open(data: Data) -> Json<Template> {`\r\n\r\nDue to an mistake, when implementing something different I just copied the whole function and forgot to change the routing accordingly. Basically I just had two routings pointing to different handler but mapping to the same name.\r\n\r\nIt compiled just fine, but when starting my application it crashed right away. After I realized that this was most likely the same routing I changed it and the application did not crash anymore.\r\n\r\nOf course this was my issue but I would rather expect that rocket will either just bind the first mapping or the last registered. In any case it should not just fade away with a crash imho.\r\n\r\nThis is not an important issue, but I guess it would make rocket even more awesome as is already is if you could fix it. The operating system I used was Windows 10 - Enterprise, latest patch level.\r\n\r\nThank you very much,\r\nmitp0sh","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/610","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/610/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/610/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/610/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/610","id":315418601,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTU0MTg2MDE=","number":610,"title":"Returning a temporary file and deleting it afterwards","user":{"login":"a-dma","id":711165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMTE2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/711165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-dma","html_url":"https://github.com/a-dma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-dma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-dma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-dma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-dma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-dma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-dma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-dma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-dma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-dma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":343542075,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNDM1NDIwNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-04-18T10:17:53Z","updated_at":"2018-04-18T14:39:53Z","closed_at":"2018-04-18T13:37:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is a question about how to return temporary files using Rocket.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using Rocket version 0.3.8 and I would like to serve a temporary file that is created as part of the request handling and (ideally) deleted as soon as the response has been sent.\r\nOne obvious solution is to create the file, read all of its content in memory, delete the file and send the response. However, since the created file can be large, I would like to use `NamedFile` or `Stream` to accomplish this.\r\nAs far as I can tell if I use either of those methods the file will survive the request, and I will have to do something myself to delete the file afterwards (spawn a thread?). Fairings don't seem to help either because they would only execute before the response is sent. Is there any hook I can use for running code _after_ a response has been sent? Any other way to achieve this?\r\n\r\nThanks","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/607","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/607/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/607/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/607/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/607","id":314377824,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTQzNzc4MjQ=","number":607,"title":"[nightly] compile error on nightly-2018-04-15-x86_64-apple-darwin","user":{"login":"zengsai","id":163317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/163317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengsai","html_url":"https://github.com/zengsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengsai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":343542073,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNDM1NDIwNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SergioBenitez/Rocket/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-04-15T01:53:38Z","updated_at":"2018-04-15T12:14:11Z","closed_at":"2018-04-15T01:54:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"error message:\r\n```shell\r\nerror[E0599]: no variant named `TupField` found for type `syntax::ast::ExprKind` in the current scope\r\n   --> /Users/Sai/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/pear_codegen-0.0.15/src/lib.rs:339:9\r\n    |\r\n339 |         ExprKind::TupField(indexed_expr, i) => {\r\n    |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ variant not found in `syntax::ast::ExprKind`\r\n\r\nerror[E0599]: no variant named `TupField` found for type `syntax::ast::ExprKind` in the current scope\r\n   --> /Users/Sai/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/pear_codegen-0.0.15/src/lib.rs:340:51\r\n    |\r\n340 |             let remake = |new_expr: Vec<P<Expr>>| ExprKind::TupField(new_expr[0].clone(), i);\r\n    |                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ variant not found in `syntax::ast::ExprKind`\r\n\r\nerror: aborting due to 2 previous errors\r\n\r\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0599`.\r\nerror: Could not compile `pear_codegen`.\r\nwarning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...\r\nerror: build failed\r\n```","score":1.0}]}
