\r\n\r\nI'm using the lastest version of rocket in my project and stumbled over a small issue:\r\n\r\nI have define a route for a POST like this:\r\n\r\n`#[post(\"/service/xxx/ep-project-blah\", format = \"application/octet-stream\", data = \"<data>\")]\r\npub fn service_endpoint_project_open(data: Data) -> Json<Template> {`\r\n\r\nDue to an mistake, when implementing something different I just copied the whole function and forgot to change the routing accordingly. Basically I just had two routings pointing to different handler but mapping to the same name.\r\n\r\nIt compiled just fine, but when starting my application it crashed right away. After I realized that this was most likely the same routing I changed it and the application did not crash anymore.\r\n\r\nOf course this was my issue but I would rather expect that rocket will either just bind the first mapping or the last registered. In any case it should not just fade away with a crash imho.\r\n\r\nThis is not an important issue, but I guess it would make rocket even more awesome as is already is if you could fix it.
