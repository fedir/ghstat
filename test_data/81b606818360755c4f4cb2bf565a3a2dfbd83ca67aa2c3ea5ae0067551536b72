was testing vgo the other day, trying to import some 3rd party dependencies that have version v2.0 or higher released on Github, but I couldn't figure out how.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nGiven [github.com/go-chi/chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) has latest version v3.3.2 released as a [git tag](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/releases/tag/v3.3.2) on Github,\r\nI'd like to import `github.com/go-chi/chi/v3` in my project, develop against it and eventually vendor it via `vgo vendor`.\r\n\r\n```go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport \"github.com/go-chi/chi/v3\"\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\t_ = chi.NewRouter()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut since github.com/go-chi/chi didn't release a v3 module yet, I get this error:\r\n```bash\r\n$ vgo run main.go\r\nvgo: creating new go.mod: module github.com/VojtechVitek/vgo-test\r\nvgo: resolving import \"github.com/go-chi/chi/v3\"\r\nvgo: finding github.com/go-chi/chi (latest)\r\nvgo: adding github.com/go-chi/chi v1.0.0\r\nvgo: import \"github.com/go-chi/chi/v3\" [/Users/vojtechvitek/go/src/v/github.com/go-chi/chi@v1.0.0/v3]: open /Users/vojtechvitek/go/src/v/github.com/go-chi/chi@v1.0.0/v3: no such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nvgo found version v1.0.0 but couldn't find \"v3\" subpkg. So I added an explicit version to my go.mod file and tried again:\r\n```\r\n$ cat go.mod\r\nmodule github.com/VojtechVitek/vgo-test\r\n\r\nrequire (\r\n\tgithub.com/go-chi/chi v3.3.2\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nrunning vgo again caused a silent side effect:\r\n```diff\r\nmodule github.com/VojtechVitek/vgo-test\r\n\r\nrequire (\r\n- \tgithub.com/go-chi/chi v3.3.2\r\n+ \tgithub.com/go-chi/chi v0.0.0-20171222161133-e83ac2304db3\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHmm, seems like vgo doesn't see any v2.0+ tags? After reading some more blog posts on https://research.swtch.com (since `vgo` CLI help didn't seem to be very helpful / novice user friendly), I confirmed with:\r\n```\r\n$ vgo list -t github.com/go-chi/chi\r\ngithub.com/go-chi/chi\r\n\tv0.9.0\r\n\tv1.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, I might be missing something, but it's not really clear to me how can I import v2.0+ or v3.0+ of a package (should I say module?) that I don't have any control over and \"is not ready yet\".\r\n\r\nAre there any guidelines for package consumers about this? Are there any guidelines for package authors? I couldn't find anything useful neither in research.swtch.com/vgo-module, nor in the accepted proposal or in the [wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/vgo).\r\n\r\n\r\n// EDIT:\r\n```\r\n$ vgo list -t github.com/go-chi/chi/v3\r\ngithub.com/go-chi/chi/v3\r\n\tv3.0.0\r\n\tv3.1.0\r\n\tv3.1.1\r\n\tv3.1.2\r\n\tv3.1.3\r\n\tv3.1.4\r\n\tv3.1.5\r\n\tv3.2.0\r\n\tv3.2.1\r\n\tv3.3.0\r\n\tv3.3.1\r\n\tv3.3.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAhaa, so I can list v3.0+ tags. But how do I use them in my monorepo properly?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ vgo get github.com/go-chi/chi/v3\r\nvgo: creating new go.mod: module github.com/VojtechVitek/vgo-test\r\nvgo: github.com/go-chi/chi/v3

to update the Twirp route protocol from the current pattern:\r\n```\r\n<baseURL>/twirp/<package>.<Service>/<Method>\r\n```\r\nto a new pattern where the `/twirp` prefix is optional and can be changed for any other prefix:\r\n```\r\n<baseURL>[prefix]/<package>.<Service>/<Method>\r\n```\r\n\r\nExamples of valid Twirp URLs with different prefixes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://example.com/twirp/package.Service/Method     // default /twirp prefix\r\nhttps://example.com/a/z/prfx/package.Service/Method  // custom prefix\r\nhttps://example.com/package.Service/Method           // no prefix\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Backwards compatibility\r\n\r\nThis is a backwards-compatible change.\r\n\r\nExisting clients and services will use the `/twirp` prefix by default, but the constructors will offer a new option to specify a different prefix, or use an empty value for no prefix.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nPR: #264\r\n\r\nFor other languages, some implementations are already prepared for \"v6 routes\" (removing the /twirp prefix was part of the [v6 protocol draft](https://twitchtv.github.io/twirp/docs/spec_v6.html), but it ended up being canceled). For example, the [Twirp-Ruby](https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp-ruby/wiki) already requires services to be mounted on routes like \"http://localhost:3000/twirp\" where the \"twirp\" prefix is already part of the baseURL. This [Twirp-Typescript](https://github.com/larrymyers/protoc-gen-twirp_typescript#generating-code-for-twirp-v6) implementation have an option to generate code with the \"v6\" option to avoid adding the \"/twirp\" prefix.\r\n\r\nOther languages can follow a similar process to the Go PR to allow optional prefixes.\r\n\r\n### Related issues\r\n\r\nSimilar attempts to change the `/twirp` prefix and routing were made before. Adding them here for reference, and also how they compare to this proposal:\r\n\r\n * #55 Proposed new routing format: /package/service/method: This change is different. The route suffix `<package>.<Service>/<Method>` will not be changed, which makes backwards compatibility a lot easier. However, that issue contains valuable comments about changing the route scheme. Please check for more details.\r\n * #48 Add support for custom route prefixes: This issue would be fixed with the proposed baseURL that allows to mount Twirp services on any sub-route.\r\n * #54 gorilla mux not working with twirp handler: This issue would be fixed as well.\r\n * #179 v6 removal of /twirp prefix makes upgrading hard: This issue covers in detail why changing the URL format of Twirp requests is really hard to do without breaking backwards compatibility. In one of the options, it mentions leaving the \"/twirp\" path prefix as a default prefix, but allow it to be customized. The idea was to allow customization through an option on the proto file, but that requires extra steps when generating code and that is not ideal. The solution here is a mix of the proposed options 1. and 2.; leaving the baseURL outside of the proto definition, allowing to \"mount\" the twirp service on any prefix, so there are no extra steps when generating code, and no mandatory steps when upgrading to the latest Twirp version.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/go/issues/2969","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/go","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/go/issues/2969/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/go/issues/2969/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/go/issues/2969/events","html_url":"https://github.com/stellar/go/issues/2969","id":688558723,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODg1NTg3MjM=","number":2969,"title":"Federation server install/configure on linux server","user":{"login":"guru-god","id":30922105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTIyMTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30922105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guru-god","html_url":"https://github.com/guru-god","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guru-god/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guru-god/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guru-god/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guru-god/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guru-god/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guru-god/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guru-god/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guru-god/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guru-god/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2020-08-29T16:01:53Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T15:24:02Z","closed_at":"2020-08-31T13:52:53Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### What problem does your feature solve?\r\nMy environment is as following : Linux (Centos), MySQL\r\nI downloaded latest release of horizon and tried to upload cfg file as config and set dsn as mysql.\r\nAfter all done of above, I run ./horizon, but it gives me error this : \r\n\r\n2020/08/29 15:56:33 Invalid config: db-url is blank.

Yesterday I could see what you've done, including black curve with _N_ values attached, for both tabs. Great. Today I can't access http://www.esci-precision.thenewstatistics.com/#tab-1\r\n\r\nI get message \"server IP address could not be found\"\r\n\r\nThese first spec comments are based on my memory of what you have done, plus some decisions Bob and I made on zoom yesterday.\r\n\r\nCall this component 'precision for planning' all through. Both words matter.\r\n\r\nTwo tabs for the two cases is good. Call these 'Two Independent Groups' and 'Paired Design'\r\n\r\nIn general, follow the font sizes and spacing of 'distributions', which also has two tabs. I.e. more spacing than the initial version of 'precision'.\r\n\r\nLooking back to ESCI for UTNS (the file ESCI chapters 10-13), there were three precision for planning pages, including one for single samples. Also black z curves were plotted. We've decided not to ask for a single sample tab, and not to include the z case. I.e. generally follow ESCI intro, not the earlier ESCI for UTNS.\r\n\r\nWe would like the MoE sampling distribution curve always to be displayed--the small curve at the bottom. I'll make a separate issue about how to calculate this. I'm still trying to convince myself that what I did in ESCI is correct :-)\r\n\r\nAt the Paired Design tab, let's have separate panels for the top two items: Population correlation, and Target MoE.\r\n\r\nOn both curves (on average, and with assurance) have dots and _N_ values at intervals of 0.05 of target MoE, as you have done. The numbers can be turned off. There are also (slightly larger, and/or bold) numbers where the cursor intersects a line, and these numbers can't be turned off.\r\n\r\nAt both tabs, let's have the Target MoE axis run from 0 to 2.0, with the slider allowing choice of values between 0.05 and 2.0, in steps of 0.005, i.e. much finer than in ESCI. (Let's have a look at how that looks and feels. It may be better to have the axis run to a smaller upper limit, as in ESCI intro (1.5). Also, it may be ok to let the slider go a little below 0.05.)\r\n\r\nFor Paired Design, let's have the rho slider run from 0 to .99, in steps of .005, i.e. shorter range and finer steps than in ESCI intro.\r\n\r\nOn opening (arrival from Main Menu), each tab is set to 'truncate display' at 0.25 and Target MoE = 0.4. 'Display all _N_ values' is ON. Paired Design tab is set to rho = .70. Only the black curve ('on average') is displayed.\r\n\r\nState of a tab is saved, so that if switch to the other tab, then return, see the first tab just as we'd left it. (This is unlike distributions, in which returning to a tab always finds it back in its default state.) Let's see how this works--I'm thinking of making it easy to switch back and forth to see how _N_ values compare for the two designs.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sf9v/multi-select-facet/issues/6","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sf9v/multi-select-facet","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sf9v/multi-select-facet/issues/6/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sf9v/multi-select-facet/issues/6/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sf9v/multi-select-facet/issues/6/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sf9v/multi-select-facet/issues/6","id":709806516,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MDk4MDY1MTY=","number":6,"title":" module declares its path as: github.com/stevenferrer/solr-go  but was required as: github.com/sf9v/solr-go","user":{"login":"domini1969","id":44922281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTIyMjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/44922281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domini1969","html_url":"https://github.com/domini1969","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domini1969/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domini1969/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domini1969/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domini1969/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domini1969/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domini1969/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domini1969/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domini1969/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domini1969/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2020-09-27T20:04:27Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T04:17:26Z","closed_at":"2020-09-29T04:17:26Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Please suggest how to build and run this repo on windows with all dependencies installed locally.\r\n\r\nGreat piece of work Steven!","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/736","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/736/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/736/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/736/events","html_url":"https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/issues/736","id":683238599,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODMyMzg1OTk=","number":736,"title":"üì¢ v2 - Changelog","user":{"login":"Fenny","id":25108519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTA4NTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25108519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny","html_url":"https://github.com/Fenny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2064310314,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDY0MzEwMzE0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%20Wait%20for%20Release","name":"üè∑ Wait for Release","color":"abd406","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2064310326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDY0MzEwMzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/labels/%F0%9F%98%8E%20Nice%20to%20Have","name":"üòé Nice to Have","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":19,"created_at":"2020-08-21T03:47:40Z","updated_at":"2020-09-16T01:35:53Z","closed_at":"2020-09-14T12:22:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"__Updated September 14, 2020__ ( [**üöÄ v2 benchmark results**](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/issues/773) )\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <a href=\"https://gofiber.io\">\r\n    <img alt=\"Fiber\" height=\"125\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gofiber/docs/master/static/fiber_v2_logo.svg\">\r\n  </a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nDear Gophers, after long discussions in our <a href=\"https://gofiber.io/discord\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/704680098577514527?style=flat&label=%F0%9F%92%AC%20discord&color=00ACD7\" height=\"15\"></a>, we decided to release `v2.0.0` on **15 September 2020**. We will summarize our current API proposal in this post, feedback is more than welcome.\r\n\r\n---\r\n‚ö† **Breaking Changes**\r\n-\r\n- ***func(c \\*fiber.Ctx) error*** is the new ***Handler*** type accepting an error return, this will simplify error handling and create cleaner code because you can directly return outgoing methods like ***c.Send()***, ***c.Next()***, ***c.SendStatus()***, ***c.Redirect()***  etc... https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/issues/218\r\n```go\r\n// func(c *fiber.Ctx) {}\r\n   func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {}\r\n```\r\n```go\r\napp.Use(func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {\r\n    if c.Get(\"x-john\") == \"doe\" {\r\n        return c.Next()\r\n    }\r\n    return c.SendStatus(fiber.StatusForbidden)\r\n})\r\n\r\napp.Use(\"/teapot\", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {\r\n    return c.Send([]byte(\"Helllo, Teapot ‚òï!\"))\r\n})\r\n\r\napp.Get(\"/world\", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {\r\n    return c.SendString(\"Hello, World üëã!\")\r\n})\r\n\r\napp.Get(\"/redirect\", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {\r\n    return c.Redirect(\"https://google.com\")\r\n})\r\n```\r\n- ***fiber.New()*** takes an optional ***Config*** struct as value that will replace the ***\\*Settings*** pointer.\r\n```go\r\n// func New(settings ...*Settings) *App {}\r\n   func New(config...

This option is useful as anti-DoS protection for servers accepting only GET requests and will return an `ErrMethodNotAllowed` to the error handler. The request size is limited by ReadBufferSize if GETOnly is set.
