[x] base\n  - [x] templates\n- [x] Use UglifyJS to combine JS to xxx.min.js packages\n  - [x] base\n  - [x] templates\n\nEdit: There is no elegant way to minify assets with PHP, this is basicly the job of build tools like CSSNano and UglifyJS running with NodeJS - therefore we remove the Minifier, the Loader can do basic concatenation of files, this is enough for us\n\nThis refactoring is related to issue #166 because collecting of files should be the job of someone else living in it's own namespace. Therefore the Asset functionality will be used by the <code>Head/Script</code> and <code>Head/Style</code> class.\n## Actual state:\n1. There are [.loader](https://github.com/redaxmedia/redaxscript/blob/master/templates/default/scripts/.loader) files in each template\n\n<pre>\n[inherit]\n#\n# templates can inherit from the .loader file other templates, in this case from admin\n#\n1 = admin\n\n[single]\n#\n# this files will not be combined and rendered via script src=\"...\" tag\n#\n1 = //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js\n2 = scripts/fallback.js\n\n[template_init]\n#\n# template assets that will be combined and rendered inside the the head tag\n# https://github.com/redaxmedia/redaxscript/blob/master/templates/default/head.phtml#L24\n#\n1 = scripts/support.js\n2 = scripts/init.js\n3 = templates/default/scripts/init.js\n\n[template]\n#\n# template assets that will be combined and rendered before body tag closing\n# https://github.com/redaxmedia/redaxscript/blob/master/templates/default/index.phtml#L49\n#\n1 = scripts/dialog.js\n2 = scripts/form.js\n3 = scripts/interface.js\n4 = scripts/misc.js\n\n[settings]\n#\n# render inline via script tag or via ?p=loader route\n# rewrite image urls\n# minify output\n#\ndeploy = inline\nrewrite = false\nminify = true\n</pre>\n1. The [loader](https://github.com/redaxmedia/redaxscript/blob/master/includes/loader.php#L18) function is collecting all the .loader files and merges files as needed\n2. Depending on the \"deploy\" setting it renders a script tag with inline code or a src=\"loader/scripts\"\n3. The route \"loader/scripts\" and \"loader/styles\" are not cached and generated on each request - [index.php](https://github.com/redaxmedia/redaxscript/blob/3.0.0/index.php#L28-L31) and [install.php](https://github.com/redaxmedia/redaxscript/blob/3.0.0/install.php#L16-L19) still have the code for a global routing\n4. The template tags for rendering [scripts](https://github.com/redaxmedia/redaxscript/blob/master/includes/loader.php#L292) and [styles](https://github.com/redaxmedia/redaxscript/blob/master/includes/loader.php#L212) tags are inside the loader.php\n5. The [transport](https://github.com/redaxmedia/redaxscript/blob/master/includes/loader.php#L393) of PHP variables to JS variables are inside the loader.php\n## Target state:\n1. First of all, forget the old code and idea of .loader files - do not copy and paste code!!!\n2. Collecting (equals the .loader config) of CSS and JS files is no longer a task of the loader\n3. Rendering script and style tags is no longer task of the loader\n4. The Assetic/Loader should be able to retrieve a config of array and does the job of the current <code>loader</code> function what basicly means combining files via include and returning the result\n5. The Assetic/Loader should take care of caching by dropping files to <code>/cache/{hash}</code> - the hash is being created from the config array keys and values - so it should be unique\n6. Assetic/Transport can transport PHP variables to JS variables via inline Javascript - keep all the DEFAULT transports for selected registry, whole language, baseURL, generator and version\n7. <del>The Assetic/Minifier is for minifying scripts and styles</del>\n8. The bundle of Assetic will be consumed by the <code>Head/Style</code> and <code>Head/Script</code> classes, those classes provide the config array of files to be included, merged, minified and cached\n\n**What happens if the Assetic/Loader cannot create the cache files?**\n1. The whole thing is going to break?\n2. There is a route like /loader/{hash} fallback to fetch the result like in the actual state?\n3. The Head/Script and Head/Link is using a inline script and style tags?\n4. The Head/Loader nothing and therefore output each file in a single tag?\n\nSuggestion how to start:\n- Use the TDD approach\n- Do not start the Assetic bundle before the Head bundle\n- Write the Assetic classes and methods according to needs of the Head bundle, if you implement Template::scripts()->minify() you have to write the Assetic/Minifier class ... and so on\n- Write unit tests for the Assetic even if code parts are covered by the Head bundle\n- Insure that the default transported variables are present: https://snag.gy/CNTlbm.jpg\n\nTodo for integration:\n- [x] Remove all the .loader files inside the templates\n- [x] Remove the global routing in index.php and install.php\n- [x] Remove Minifier class and related testing stuff\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/j4mie/idiorm/issues/259","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/j4mie/idiorm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/j4mie/idiorm/issues/259/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/j4mie/idiorm/issues/259/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/j4mie/idiorm/issues/259/events","html_url":"https://github.com/j4mie/idiorm/issues/259","id":54048451,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NDA0ODQ1MQ==","number":259,"title":"Multiple Likes in Query","user":{"login":"redaxmedia","id":1835397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzUzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1835397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/redaxmedia","html_url":"https://github.com/redaxmedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redaxmedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redaxmedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redaxmedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redaxmedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redaxmedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redaxmedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redaxmedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redaxmedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redaxmedia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":20795934,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDc5NTkzNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/j4mie/idiorm/labels/Easy%20Pick","name":"Easy Pick","color":"d7e102","default":false,"description":null},{"id":29845425,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTg0NTQyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/j4mie/idiorm/labels/Support","name":"Support","color":"DDDDDD","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-01-12T12:31:26Z","updated_at":"2016-06-14T08:52:33Z","closed_at":"2015-03-12T22:05:23Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hello,\n\nI have a question about the most accurate way to use Idiorm with multiple likes:\n\n<pre>'title LIKE \\'%' . $value .
