However, .NET Core fixed this API in 2.0 to correctly call the parameterless constructor of a struct if one is present, and **since we now tie language version to the target platform there will be no supported scenario with this bug.**\r\n\r\nUp until C# 8.0 it was possible to use syntax features of C# 8 and everything that was just sugar worked in .NET Framework and .NET Standard 2.0. When you provide the types, even nullable reference types work in .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nAm I reading this correct, that the intention is to block new syntax features for code bases that do not target .NET 5 or later and if so, which C# version will introduce this? Right now, I'm mostly concerned about null-checks, since this is a feature I intended to apply to my entire code base once it's available. There's of course a bunch of other features, too, such as target-typed new, pattern matching improvements, local function improvements, which do not depend on the underlying platform. \r\n\r\nWhen maintaining a code base that multi-targets .NET Framework, .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 5 (or possibly just .NET Standard 2.0, if possible based on the dependencies), it would be very unfortunate to be blocked from using the latest syntactical sugar.

Essentially it is an open source Microsoft  project that features an api and tooling to help create PWAs.\r\n\r\nEssentially the problem is that Azure Client libraries such as the Azure Blob Storage Client API library makes use of a lot of async functions, which cannot be called directly within the space of a current Durable Function Orchestrator primarily due to the Orchestrator being a synchronous generator function. The tweak to it being compatible with Async Generator functions would solve this issue.\r\n\r\nThe example I am listing below can be done with chaining, and hence we are not blocked, but it would be quite convenient if we were able to do async operations within the generator. It would save us creating a function call just to retrieve the async information and remove the need for a sub-orchestrator and make the durable function framework more compatible with some of the other azure resources available.\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\n\r\nOur use case is using blob storage as a temporary storage point for a collection of images that will then need to be scanned quickly to generate the missing images.\r\n\r\n## Chaining\r\n\r\n- Separate activity to query blob storage and grab the images that need to be generated.\r\n- Calls a sub-orchestrator to fan out the image calls to copy and resize the largest image.\r\n- Zipping and etc (not relevant)\r\n\r\n## Code Visual\r\n### Chaining Code\r\n```typescript\r\nconst orchestrator = df.orchestrator(function* (context, clientData) {\r\n  // to get information from azure client libraries\r\n  const missingImageList = yield context.df.callActivity(\"GetMissingImages\", clientData);\r\n\r\n  // sub-orchestrator\r\n  const responses = yield context.df.callActivity(\"GenerateMissingImagesSubOrchestrator\", clientData, missingImageList);\r\n  return yield context.df.callActivity(\"getZip\", clientData);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Async Operator\r\n\r\n- Queries inside the orchestrator for the images and then fans out from this context the generate activities. 2 less functions to manage\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst orchestrator = df.orchestrator(async function* (context, clientData) {\r\n  const serviceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString();\r\n  /* ... subsequent code in missingImageList (mostly async calls).\r\n     ...\r\n     results in missingImageList\r\n  */\r\n  const missingImageListActivties = missingImageList\r\n            .filter(image => /* check set of image sizes */)\r\n            .map(context.df.callActivity(\"ResizeImage\", /* you get the idea */));\r\n  const responses = yield context.df.Task.all(missingImageListActivties);\r\n  return yield context.df.callActivity(\"getZip\", clientData);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vavr-io/vavr/issues/2398","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vavr-io/vavr","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vavr-io/vavr/issues/2398/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vavr-io/vavr/issues/2398/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vavr-io/vavr/issues/2398/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr/issues/2398","id":425806705,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MjU4MDY3MDU=","number":2398,"title":"Interoperability

That is typically for boiler-plate code to start a host. Now I find myself in there constantly making changes just to work on my DI pipeline, for example:\r\n\r\n**Program.cs:**\r\n\r\n\t// ...\r\n\tpublic static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>\r\n\t\tHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n\t\t.ConfigureServices(services =>\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t// add services here\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t// ...\r\n\r\n### I'd like to see...\r\nIt would be really convenient to segregate the boiler-plate code from the DI injection routines.

' active' : '' }`].join(' ') }>\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Drawbacks\r\n\r\nWhy should we *not* do this? Please consider:\r\n\r\nThere are no drawbacks, since the dot symbol was previously prohibited, backward compatibility is present.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage is that jsx with the new syntax will cause a syntax error in compilers that do not support the new function. therefore, we must write babel-plugin to translate the new code into the \"old\" jsx.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\n\r\nYou can write the babel plugin to support the new syntax, but this will not motivate the creators of the IDE to add new syntax. The popularity of React and Facebook and the headline \"React 17.0 - New Syntax for Classes.\" will motivate support  this feature.\r\n\r\n# Adoption strategy\r\n\r\nReact competitors use much more convenient syntax than jsx. Since it uses attributes starting with special characters. jsx does not use such attributes, and simply prohibits them. People are tormented by class definitions in jsx and rejoice in Angular and Vue. People will be happy with the new ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù syntax, which will be much more organic than native html. Since in css classes start with a dot, in jsx they will also start with a dot. And also the most common operation with classes is adding or removing a class, depending on the state. We add and make it native. There is not a single developer in the world who says \"bliiin, well, support for convenient classes has appeared (\" and there are 99% of people who say \"FINALLY\" =)\r\n\r\n# How we teach this\r\n\r\nThis innovation is sugar, and does not break or change existing behavior. Therefore, we can simply ADD a new section to the \"dot classes\" documentation. Those who like the new syntax will use it, those who like the old will use the old. Anyone who likes both syntaxes can combine them. className is just a string, so at the jsx compilation stage we can quietly unify both methods of class declaration.\r\n\r\n# Unresolved questions\r\n\r\nSince we are doing such a thing, then maybe we should immediately think about isolated styles for the component? Since we are making syntax changes, it may be that we think over the isolation of styles in advance? After all, if we implement this without thinking it over, then we will not be able to change it on the future. I suggest thinking about how to natively (from the point of view of jsx) and syntactically solve the problem of encapsulating classes, and how to make it flexible enough so that other encapsulation libraries can USE this syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\nby the way, we can also add dynamic attribute names\r\n===\r\n\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nlet prop = \"ololo\"\r\n<div [prop]=\"value\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\ncompile to:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlet prop = \"ololo\"\r\nReact.createElement('div', { [prop]: \"value\"} )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplus this syntax allows you to finally do this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction List(props) {\r\n  return <ul .list {...props}></ul>\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Component() {\r\n  return <List .red></List>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nits render to:\r\n```jsx\r\n<ul className=\"lisit red></ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nability at the precompilation stage to competently concatenate dot classes and className is phenomenal =)\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdequate guys, do you want me to write a transpiler plugin for this syntax, and add support for it in your IDEs? Who agrees? I think to create a separate repository =)\r\n\r\n\r\nUPD:\r\n===\r\n\r\ncheers guys, I came up with a workaround !!!! thank god these guys did not forbid the dollar symbol !!! =)\r\n===\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<div $chat $active={ false } $opened={ null }></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will write a babel plugin that implements the behavior that I described here. the dollar sign will temporarily act as a dot symbol =) this way we can test new syntax\r\n\r\nyes, it breaks backward compatibility, since now you can‚Äôt use properties starting with the dollar sign, but it's not my fault, but the guys from React =)\r\n\r\nbut living even that way will be much easier. of course it's a fierce crutch, but at least something\r\n\r\np.s. yes and goodbye typescript\r\n\r\n\r\nI experimented a lot, and technically, the length of such a syntax is literally equal to the length of the syntax I proposed:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60403187/80938942-9c718780-8de3-11ea-8d0a-ed9f85c92362.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut visually the dollar symbool is annoying and far less logical than the dot symbool. \r\n\r\nto implement override and disable classes semantics, I will write the runtime mergeProps function, but this will be the next

from #3240.\r\n\r\nNull-conditional member access (`?.`) was implemented and will be available as an _experimental_ feature in 7.0\r\n\r\nHowever, in the interest of backward compatibility **the implementation currently requires that the variable name be enclosed  in `{...}`**, because `?` is technically a legal character in a variable name whose use surprisingly _doesn't_ require `{...}`.\r\n\r\nThat is, if you want to ignore an attempt to call`$obj.Method()` if `$obj` is `$null` (or undefined), you would expect the following, analogous to C#:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Does NOT work as intended.\r\n# 'obj?' as a whole is interpreted as the variable name.\r\n$obj?.Method()\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, you must currently use:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# !! Must enclose 'obj' in {...} to signal that '?' is a syntactic element as part of '?.'\r\n${obj}?.Method()\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Update_: Null-coalescing - `$var??='default` and `$a??$b` - and the ternary operator - `$var?1:0` - are similarly affected (though there the use of whitespace before the `?` resolves the issue).\r\n\r\nThis requirement is (a) unexpected and (b) cumbersome:\r\n\r\n* New users will not expect the need for `{...}` and won't necessarily know that _it_ is what is required when the following fails (possibly _undetected_, unless `Set-StrictMode -Version 2` or higher is in effect): `$o = [pscustomobject] @{ one = 1 }; $o?.one`\r\n\r\n* Even once users _do_ know about the need for `{...}`:\r\n  * They will forget to use it on occasion, because of the counter-intuitive need for it.\r\n  * When they do remember, this seemingly artificial requirement will be an ongoing source of frustration, especially since `{...}` is hard to type.\r\n\r\n**Use of `{...}` shouldn't be necessary, and while not requiring it amounts to a _breaking_ change, it arguably falls into [bucket 3: Unlikely Grey Area](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-3-unlikely-grey-area).**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Why this change should be considered acceptable:\r\n\r\nNote: @rjmholt discusses why changing PowerShell's syntax is highly problematic _in general_ in [this comment](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3240#issuecomment-565745004), but for the reasons presented below I think it is worth making an exception here.\r\n\r\n`?.` is a _new_ syntactic feature; by definition scripts that use it _cannot_ (meaningfully) run on older versions - unless you specifically add conditionals that provide legacy-version-compatible code paths, but that seems hardly worth it - you would then just stick with the legacy features.\r\n\r\nYes, the interpretation of `$var?.foo` in old scripts that used `$var?` as  a variable name would break, but:\r\n\r\n* `?` should never have been allowed as part of an identifier _without enclosing it in `{...}`_.\r\n\r\n* Since being able to do so is unexpected and probably even _unknown_ to many, such variable names are exceedingly rare in the wild, speaking from personal experience, but [@mburszley's analysis provides more tangible evidence](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3240#issuecomment-526179551).\r\n\r\n   * Even Ruby only allows `?` (and `!`) at the _end_ of identifiers, and there only of _method_ identifiers, and I suspect that most Ruby users are aware that they should _not_ assume that other languages support the same thing.\r\n\r\nSo, pragmatically speaking:\r\n\r\n* The vast majority of existing code will not be affected - a token such as `$var?.foo` will simply not be encountered.\r\n\r\n* If you write `$var?.foo` with the new semantics, then yes, running that on older versions could result in different behavior (rather than breaking in an obvious manner), depending on what strict mode is in effect - but _you should always enforce the minimum version required to run your code as intended anyway_ (`#requires -Version`, module-manifest keys).\r\n\r\nAll in all, to me this a clear case of a bucket 3 change: a technically breaking change that breaks very little existing code while offering real benefits (or, conversely, avoiding perennial headaches due to unexpected behavior).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/runtime/issues/36517","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/runtime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/runtime/issues/36517/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/runtime/issues/36517/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/runtime/issues/36517/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36517","id":618741750,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MTg3NDE3NTA=","number":36517,"title":"Inconsistent `ParamName` for `ArgumentException`s","user":{"login":"Youssef1313","id":31348972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzQ4OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/31348972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Youssef1313","html_url":"https://github.com/Youssef1313","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Youssef1313/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Youssef1313/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Youssef1313/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Youssef1313/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Youssef1313/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Youssef1313/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Youssef1313/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Youssef1313/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Youssef1313/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1675385813,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjc1Mzg1ODEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/runtime/labels/area-System.Runtime","name":"area-System.Runtime","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1576303481,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc2MzAzNDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/runtime/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f49cb1","default":true,"description":"Product bug (most likely)"},{"id":1675386284,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjc1Mzg2Mjg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/runtime/labels/up-for-grabs","name":"up-for-grabs","color":"23ef90","default":false,"description":"Good issue for external contributors"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/runtime/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/runtime/milestones/1/labels","id":4844037,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDg0NDAzNw==","number":1,"title":"Future","description":"Milestone tracking issues not triaged to a planned release.

I'm using v1.11.2 of the adapter for react-16 my tests pass, snapshots are created and everything appears to be working well, however, a warning is repeatedly logged out from `react-dom`.\r\n\r\nHere's the test in question:\r\n```\r\n    it(\"should render a link block when the api responds with content\", () => {\r\n        const linkBlockResponse = {\r\n            title: \"Useful links\",\r\n            links: [\r\n                {\r\n                    title: \"Book a flight\",\r\n                    description: \"for your next trip\",\r\n                    image: {\r\n                        url: \"www.someimage.com\",\r\n                        name: \"some image\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    link: {\r\n                        url: \"www.google.com\",\r\n                        name: \"google\",\r\n                        target: \"_blank\",\r\n                    }\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    title: \"Gates & Time\",\r\n                    description: \"Departures & Arrivals\",\r\n                    image: {\r\n                        url: \"www.someotherimage.com\",\r\n                        name: \"some other image\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    link: {\r\n                        url: \"www.google.com\",\r\n                        name: \"google\",\r\n                        target: \"_blank\",\r\n                    }\r\n                },\r\n            ]\r\n        } as LinkBlock;\r\n\r\n        const apiResponse = {\r\n            content: linkBlockResponse\r\n        } as ContentResponse<LinkBlock>;\r\n\r\n        const apiMock = jest.fn((id: number) => Promise.resolve(apiResponse));\r\n\r\n        const wrapper = enzyme.mount(<LinkBlockComponent id={1} getLinkBlock={apiMock} />);\r\n\r\n        return Promise\r\n            .resolve(wrapper)\r\n            .then(() => {\r\n                wrapper.update();\r\n                expect(apiMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);\r\n                expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot();\r\n                expect(wrapper.find(LinkBlockHeaderComponent)).toHaveLength(1);\r\n                expect(wrapper.find(LinkBlockLinksComponent)).toHaveLength(1);\r\n            });\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    console.error node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:506\r\n      Warning: An update to LinkBlockComponent inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).\r\n      \r\n      When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):\r\n      \r\n      act(() => {\r\n        /* fire events that update state */\r\n      });\r\n      /* assert on the output */\r\n      \r\n      This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser.

private state have an \"escape hatch\" like TypeScript private, or be strongly private the way that closed-over values are? Soft-private isn't fully written out the way that @zenparsing has done an excellent job on the current WeakMap-based proposal, but the core would be that \"private state\" is simply (public) symbol-named properties, with syntactic sugar for those symbols, and possibly some kind of introspection over them. It might be bad for overall language complexity/intelligibility to have both kinds of private state in the language and better to decide up-front what we want. Below, I @-mention people who either made this argument or who I think might be especially interested in the argument.\n## Soft-private\n\nSoft-private would be syntactic sugar for symbols. In ES6, you can currently write code like this:\n\n``` js\nlet x = Symbol(\"x\");\nclass Foo {\n  constructor() {\n    this[x] = 1;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith a soft-private language feature, there would be syntactic sugar that looks like this:\n\n``` js\nclass Foo {\n  #x = 1;\n}\n```\n### Advantages\n- Possibly easier solutions for friends, decorators introducing private state, etc., since it's just a matter of sharing the symbol somehow (@wycats). Introspection method TBD.\n-  One might argue that JavaScript is already so flexible and so much can be subverted that there's little value in trying to give guarantees to private state (@bterlson).\n- From a testing perspective, if tests can reach into private state, then the main code does not need anything extra written inline which should properly be only in the test code (@mhevery).\n- This is a language feature that is explained/polyfillable in terms of other language features, and doesn't create any new sort of different properties that behave differently. Therefore it's a simpler conceptual model (@justinfagnani, @ljharb).\n### Disadvantages\n- Private state is not really guaranteed private, so no hard guarantees about properties that users may expect if they want security guarantees about how their objects are used (@erights).\n- Platform objects, both within ECMAScript and in embedding environments, contain hard private state. If a library wants to be high-fidelity and just like a platform object, soft-private state does not provide this (@domenic)\n## Hard-private\n\nHard-private (the proposal described in this repository currently) is based on state that can really only be accessed by code within the class body. This has been constant across all of the different proposals that have been advanced to TC39, though not what TypeScript provides.\n### Advantages\n- Hard-private could provide actual guarantees about visibility and more assurances to library authors that their internal state will not be accessed inappropriately, allowing them to build something more like builtin internal slots. (@domenic, @erights)\n- With `static` blocks that run as part of class definition (currently not concretely proposed or championed), it would actually be possible to build getter/setter functions to share with friends (though this code may be slower, especially as the page is starting up), e.g.,\n\n``` js\nlet get, set;\nclass Foo {\n  #bar\n  static {\n    get = x => x.#bar;\n    set = (x, y) => x.#bar = y;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEven without static blocks, you could create a static method which does the exporting, though this is ugly.\n- It might be possible for implementations to do certain kinds of reasoning about private state that they cannot do about Symbols (though the extent is limited by the dynamism of the current proposal) (@sebmarkbage).\n- This is something which, to be efficient, probably has to be built into the language, unlike soft-private which can be done by a transpiler like TypeScript. If there are important use cases, then it might make sense to use our limited syntactic space for something that has to be a primitive, rather than something that a user-level transpiler could use, in the spirit of asking browsers to do what is most important to do in the browser (not that this is a goal that TC39 has agreed on). (may be interested: @wycats)\n### Disadvantages\n- This is a new language construct, introducing something that's sort of like properties but not quite. That's extra complexity. (@justinfagnani)\n- For decorator integration, we'd need a separate kind of way to declare these private properties, and a special way to refer to them in the added method bodies. Unclear how that would work exactly. Not nearly as flexible as simple symbols, which wouldn't really need much of any special support to add as decorators. (@wycats)\n- If you have a program which declares private state, but you want to reach into the private state from outside either for testing or because you want to consider the private state part of a semi-public interface for mainline code, you need to insert an unergonomic escape hatch in explicitly, rather than just apply the escape hatch the code which uses the private state. (@mhevery)\n- Public properties might be more important than private properties; that's what people use in JS today. It might not be worth it to create all this extra semantic stuff just for private state (@esprehn, @jeffmo).\n\nThoughts?\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4858","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ckeditor/ckeditor5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4858/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4858/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4858/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4858","id":504611213,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDQ2MTEyMTM=","number":4858,"title":"Automatically

Describe what isn't working as expected -->\r\nIn the following code, trying to call `CreateMovementWithTransactionAsync` is not working as expected when trying to get the `DatabaseValue` after a failed `SaveChanges` attempt.\r\nThe steps that lead to the problem are described in the comments of the code that follows.\r\n\r\nInside a transaction, we read two rows from the sabe table. the Entity `FinancialAccount` has a `[ConcurrencyCheck]` property.\r\n\r\nWe do some manipulation to force `[ConcurrencyCheck]` to throw an exception (all explained in the comments).\r\n\r\nSince `SaveChanges` threw an exception, we expect the `DatabaseValue` to be equal `OriginalValue`, and not `CurrentValue`.\r\n\r\nImportant: If the transaction is removed, everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\r\nusing System.Data;\r\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\r\nusing Acme.Domain.Business;\r\n\r\nnamespace

let me start with the sugar: this is a great project that we have used in our cyber range to great effect. \r\n\r\nI know it can do more than we have made it do, but are a little hampered by the state

Now, I know that I can go to \"localhost:5000/swagger\" and get the dynamic API documentation and some basic interface to the API.

When the phone goes out of range for more than 1 or two readings, the data stops getting captured from the sensor and the phone gets stuck \"Scanning\".  The only way I know how to resolve this is to reboot the phone (Restarting the collector does not seem to reslove this.)\r\n\r\n- One user has suggested that when they try to use SSW3 watch and atom phone, with xdrip, they have the same connectivity problems I do, but when they don't use the watch the phone functions much better.  I have a Fitbit Versa with updated 3.0 Fitbit firmware and need to be able to use the phone and watch combination, so I am reluctant to call it a problem using a watch.  \r\n\r\n- It also seems possible that after watching a video or surfing on the phone, the phone misses a couple of readings and gets stuck scanning as well, but I have not completely verified this.\r\n\r\n+++\r\n\r\nThe phone has a perfect form factor for a collector, and I would very much like to work with you to get it to function properly, for me and for others.
