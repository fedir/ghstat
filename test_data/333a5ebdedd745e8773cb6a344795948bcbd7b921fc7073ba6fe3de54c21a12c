This leads to the template not actually being reloaded in line 270. This, in turn, means that the changes in `other.scss` are not reflected when rendering. \r\n\r\nChanging the `render` function to always set `@mtime = Time.now` at the beginning of the function *produces the expected behavior*, but I'm guessing this \"disables\" template caching altogether.\r\n\r\nI can submit a PR if you point me in the right direction for a fix.\r\n\r\nThanks!","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/buzzn/core/issues/1111","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/buzzn/core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/buzzn/core/issues/1111/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/buzzn/core/issues/1111/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/buzzn/core/issues/1111/events","html_url":"https://github.com/buzzn/core/issues/1111","id":242310957,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNDIzMTA5NTc=","number":1111,"title":"Spike: Define Authentication flow across SPAs","user":{"login":"dottorer","id":14217285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14217285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dottorer","html_url":"https://github.com/dottorer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dottorer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dottorer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dottorer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dottorer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dottorer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dottorer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dottorer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dottorer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dottorer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":417398571,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MTczOTg1NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/buzzn/core/labels/Security","name":"Security","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-07-12T09:12:34Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T15:57:38Z","closed_at":"2017-08-07T08:44:15Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"We need to define our architecture for:\n- Account provisioning\n- Authentication\n- Authorization to systems\n- Session Management\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Right now we have `config.ru` - in fact it can be any file you specify to the servers `--config` option. Because that implies usage of `Rack::Builder` and the presence of middleware, I want to adjust this slightly. We would have a new default file, `myapp/rack.rb`, like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# file `rack.rb`\r\nrequire_relative 'lib/my_application'\r\nrun MyApplication.new\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Application Handler\r\n\r\nWe should simplify the request/response handler.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Request\r\n  attr :version\r\n  attr :method\r\n  attr :target\r\n  attr :headers\r\n  attr :body # responds to `#read`\r\n  attr :peer\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Response\r\n  def status=\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def headers=\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def write(chunk)\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def close\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass MyApplication\r\n  def call(request, response) \r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Compatibility with existing `config.ru`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# rack.rb\r\nrun Rack::Builder.load('config.ru')\r\n```\r\n\r\nServers could default to this behaviour if there is no `rack.rb` present. `Rack` would provide the necessary bridge between the above interface (`def call(request, response)`) and the existing rack middleware model.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeremyevans/roda/issues/165","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeremyevans/roda","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeremyevans/roda/issues/165/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeremyevans/roda/issues/165/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeremyevans/roda/issues/165/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda/issues/165","id":450935753,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTA5MzU3NTM=","number":165,"title":"Sidekiq::Web breaks roda session","user":{"login":"eiko","id":25251056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjUxMDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25251056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiko","html_url":"https://github.com/eiko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-05-31T18:52:01Z","updated_at":"2019-05-31T19:59:12Z","closed_at":"2019-05-31T19:59:12Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I've integrated Sidekiq::Web (a standard rack app) into roda like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nplugin :sessions, secret: my_secret\r\n\r\nroute do |r|\r\n  r.on 'sidekiq' do\r\n    r.run Sidekiq::Web\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I return to any part of my app after visiting `/sidekiq`, my session gets corrupted.

know this has been discussed already previously in issues #313 and #337, however, this time, I'd like to report an even more weird behavior.\r\n\r\nWe pre-compile our static assets with webpack before running the app with Puma and 2 workers (`-w 2 --preload`). We serve those assets using the Rack::Static middleware in a Roda application.\r\n\r\nIn the past few weeks I've noticed that sometimes the app wasn't loading because it was failing to download some JS and I had to re-deploy the app to fix it. Today I noticed that simply sending the USR1 signal to the app was enough to fix it, but I still don't understand what is causing this. I can currently reproduce the issue by issuing the same curl command multiple times and watching it return 200 sometimes and 404 other times for the same url. I suspect one of the workers is working as expected while the other is not but I have absolutely no idea on how to further debug what's happening.\r\n\r\nIf I try to modify the application, just after deploying it it's very unlikely I'll be able to reproduce it any time soon, so I'm wondering if there's something we could do to debug the issue without restarting the cluster. We use a blue-green deployment strategy so I don't have to restart this app until next deployment. Is there anything I can do to further track what could be causing those intermitent 404? I've made sure the issue has nothing to do with nginx because when I issue the requests inside the server itself to localhost:3000 I can see the exactly same behavior.\r\n\r\nWe're currently using Puma 3.7.1 in a Debian Linux Docker container also running in a Debian Linux host.
