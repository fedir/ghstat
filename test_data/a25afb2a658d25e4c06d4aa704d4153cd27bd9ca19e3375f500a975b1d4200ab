\r\n```scala\r\nbodyParam[List[String]](\"body\")\r\n```\r\nThe swagger generated doesn't recognize the list as a container but instead treats it as a type definition:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\":

queryParam[List[Long]]\r\n```\r\nSwagger output:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"layerIds\",\r\n  \"required\": true,\r\n  \"in\": \"query\",\r\n  \"type\": \"array\",\r\n  \"items\": {\r\n

is an aggregation ticket of Scalatra 2.6.0 progress.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of Scalatra 2.6.x is to decrease future maintenance efforts and costs, since there are not enough active committers to maintain the existing huge codebase. To achieve this goal, we focus the followings in 2.6.0:\r\n\r\n- Follow the Scala standards (e.g. Twirl instead of Scalate)\r\n- Deprecate modules that are not used much or not maintained enough\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\n- [x] Upgrade libraries and Jetty #688\r\n- [x] Remove all deprecated classes and methods #674 \r\n- [x] Adopt Twirl as the default template engine (Update g8 template) https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra-sbt.g8/pull/74\r\n\r\n## Modules\r\n\r\nWe have many modules in Scalatra, too many to be maintained by the current active committers. We wish to drop unimportant or outdated modules in the future, so we deprecate or merge some modules as follows in Scalatra 2.6.0:\r\n\r\n- [x] Deprecate Swagger 1.x support and merge scalatra-swagger-ext with scalatra-swagger #681\r\n- [x] Deprecate scalatra-commands and introduce [scalatra-forms](https://github.com/gitbucket/scalatra-forms) instead #679\r\n- [x] Deprecate scalatra-spring #673\r\n- [x] Drop scalatra-example because we have examples in scalatra-website-example by @magnolia-k\r\n- [x] Drop scalatra-fileupload because it has been already deprecated since 2.1.0 #675\r\n- [x] Merge request logging utility in scalatra-slf4j with core, and drop scalatra-slf4j #699\r\n\r\nAll deperecated features in 2.6.x will be dropped in 2.7.0 or 3.0.0.\r\n\r\n## Documents\r\n\r\n- [x] Create 2.6 guides and scaladoc https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra-website/issues/152 and #715\r\n- [x] Create 2.6 examples https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra-website-examples/pull/46\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring #729

Because I do not have unique base paths for each \"servlet,\" I am using `ScalatraFilter` instances and mounting all of them to `\"/*`. Essentially, when a request comes in, if I call `params.get(\"userId\")` from within my servlet instance (after a route has been matched), and `userId` is on the request, then the value is found almost immediately. However, if `userId` is not present on the request, the amount of time required to return `None` increases exponentially with respect to the number of `ScalatraFilter` instances in the stack above the current instance.\r\n\r\nThe execution times looked something like this:\r\n- 8 servlets / filters ~8 millis\r\n- 13 servlets / filters ~76 millis\r\n- 16 servlets / filters ~700 millis\r\n- 18 servlets / filters ~2.3 seconds\r\n- 20 servlets / filters ~3.8 seconds\r\n- 23 servlets / filters ~30 seconds\r\n- 27 servlets / filters ~4.5 minutes\r\n\r\nEssentially, the order in which one mounts `ScalatraFilter` instances to the context via `context.mount` appears to effect the execution time of seemingly unrelated operations in a surprising way.
