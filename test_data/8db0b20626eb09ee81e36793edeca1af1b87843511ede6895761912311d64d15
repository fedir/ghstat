There, we can click on the 'upload new profile picture' link, to upload a new picture, but this operation will fail.\r\n\r\nOn PHP 7.0.*, it will fail silently - it provides no feedback to the user. It simply does not accept the picture, and the page stays as it was.\r\n\r\nOn PHP 7.1.*, an error message is output: \"A non well formed numeric value encountered\" - and the operation fails, too. \r\n\r\nManually creating the *'avatars'* folder solves the issue. If lack of the folder will cause errors, then perhaps it should be included in the 'plainkit' by default - i.e., an empty folder with a *'.gitkeep'* file would suffice.","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/getkirby/getkirby.com/issues/760","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/getkirby/getkirby.com","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/getkirby/getkirby.com/issues/760/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/getkirby/getkirby.com/issues/760/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/getkirby/getkirby.com/issues/760/events","html_url":"https://github.com/getkirby/getkirby.com/issues/760","id":527544255,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1Mjc1NDQyNTU=","number":760,"title":"Try
