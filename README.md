Statistical multi-criteria decision-making comparator for selected Github's projects.

Usage example with statistics of Go open source web frameworks, maintained on Github :

    go build
    ./ghstat

After that, `result.csv` file will be created (or updated, if it's already exists) with the statistics of selected repositories.

* Age in days - newest is better :)
* Closed issues, % - more is better
* Watchers - more is better

## Current results

* The most popular project is `hugo`
* The newest project is `iris`
* The project with the most active community is `buffalo`
* The project with best errors resolving rate is `iris`
* The best project taking in account the placement multiple criterias is `hugo`
